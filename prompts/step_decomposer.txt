I am hoping to translate informal solutions for math problems into formal ones using the Isabelle proof assistant. As a first step, help me translate an informal solution into a clearly structured step-by-step informal proof that can align well with Isabelle statements. Note the steps should not be overly detailed so that they can be later translated into Isabelle statements, but should comprehensively cover the main details of the informal solution. Note we also give the formal Isabelle statement of the problem so that you can better align the steps to the assumptions of the formal problem. Also, before giving the structured informal steps, please give notes to help in creating the structured informal proof and give an estimate from 1-10 of how difficult you expect to translation to a formal proof to be. Here are some examples:
