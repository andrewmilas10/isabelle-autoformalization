I am hoping to translate informal solutions for math problems into formal ones using the Isabelle proof assistant. Using a structured step-by-step informal proof, create a formal Isabelle proof that proves each step one-by-one. Note depending on the step's complexity, you might neeed to break a step down into multiple Isabelle statements. Please make sure that all needed assumptions and facts from earlier proven steps are available as needed and use sledgehammer to prove each statement. Also, keep the following **important** tips in mind:

1. Always use sledgehammer as the proof method even if simpl or auto would suffice
2. For statements involving numerical computation, remember to include a type such as (2::nat) (this could be complex, real, or nat based on the problem) so Isabelle knows how to do the computation

Here are some examples:
