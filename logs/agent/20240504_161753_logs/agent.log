Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Given $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, substitute $c = \text{Im}(1) = \text{Im}(\text{i}) = 1$ into $a+b = 2c$ to get $a+b = 2$.
Step 2: Simplify $ac + bc$ as $(a+b)c$.
Step 3: Substitute the value of $a+b$ into the expression to get $(a+b)c = 2c$.
Step 4: Since $c = \text{i}$, we have $2c = 2\text{i}$.
Step 5: Simplify $2\text{i}$ to get $2\text{i} = -2$.
Step 6: Therefore, $ac + bc = -2$.

theorem mathd_algebra_480:
  fixes f :: "real \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes h0 : "\<And>x. x<0 \<Longrightarrow> f x = -(x^2)-1"
    and h1 : "\<And>x. (0 \<le> x \<and> x < 4) \<Longrightarrow> f x = 2"
    and h2 : "\<And>x. x\<ge>4 \<Longrightarrow> f x = sqrt x"
  shows "f pi = 2"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Since $\pi$ is between 0 and 4, it falls under the second case where $f(x) = 2$. *)
  have "0 \<le> pi \<and> pi < 4"
    by simp
  then have "f pi = 2"
    using h1
    sledgehammer
  (* Step 2: Therefore, $f(\pi) = 2$. *)
  thus ?thesis
    by simp
