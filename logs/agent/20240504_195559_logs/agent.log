---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to simplify the complex expression step by step, carefully considering real and imaginary parts.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Given $q = 9 - 4i$ and $e = -3 - 4i$, substitute to get $q - e = (9-4i) - (-3-4i)$.
Step 2: Expand by changing the signs inside the parentheses to get $9 - 4i + 3 + 4i$.
Step 3: Simplify to get $12$ by combining like terms.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Given $q = 9 - 4i$ and $e = -3 - 4i$, substitute to get $q - e = (9-4i) - (-3-4i)$. *)
  have "q - e = (Complex 9 (-4)) - (Complex (-3) (-4))"
    using h0 h1
    sledgehammer
  (* Step 2: Expand by changing the signs inside the parentheses to get $9 - 4i + 3 + 4i$. *)
  then have "q - e = Complex 9 (-4) + Complex 3 4"
    by simp
  (* Step 3: Simplify to get $12$ by combining like terms. *)
  then show "q - e = 12"
    by simp
qed
However, you encountered an error at step 2 where, specifically, you wrote by simp. Isabelle gave the following reason for the error:
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. q - e = Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) \<Longrightarrow> - Complex (- 3) (- 4) = Complex 3 4
At command "by" (line 1)
Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes
