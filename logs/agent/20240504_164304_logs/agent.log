---------------------New Problem (10: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_110.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(2-2i)(5+5i)$, where $i^2 = -1.$ Show that it is 20.

## Informal proof

Show that for any positive integer $n$, $2$ divides $4^n$.

## Informal proof
We have $4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}$. Since $n > 0$ we have that $2n > 0$, so $2$ divides $4^n$.

Let $x=\log_{5^2}5^4$. Writing the equation in exponential form gives $(5^2)^x=5^4$. So, $x=2$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_22:
  "(log 2 (5^4)) / (log 2 (5^2)) = 2"

Notes for Structured proof: The main idea here is to apply complex number multiplication and simplification step by step until we reach the final result. We need to keep track of the calculations to ensure accuracy in the formal proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Express $Q$, $E$, and $D$ in complex number form as given.
Step 2: Calculate $Q \cdot E \cdot D$ by substituting the values of $Q$, $E$, and $D$ into the expression.
Step 3: Perform the multiplication step by step: $(11-5i)(11+5i)2i$.
Step 4: Simplify the expression: $2i(121-(5i)^2)$.
Step 5: Continue simplification: $2i(121+25)$.
Step 6: Conclude that $Q \cdot E \cdot D = 292i$.
