---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_346.json) ------------------------------------
Let $f(x) = 2x-3$ and $g(x) = x+1$. What is the value of $g(f(5)-1)$? Show that it is 7.

## Informal proof
We have $f(5) = 2(5) -3 = 7$, so $g(f(5)-1) = g(7-1) = g(6) = 6+1 = 7$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_346:
  fixes f g :: "real \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes "\<forall> x. f x = 2 * x - 3"
    and "\<forall> x. g x = x + 1"
  shows "g (f 5 - 1) = 7"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The solution involves correctly applying the functions $f$ and $g$ with the given inputs.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 1
Step 1: Calculate $f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 7$.
Step 2: Compute $g(f(5)-1) = g(7-1) = g(6)$.
Step 3: Substitute into function $g$, getting $g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7$.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves function composition and evaluation. We need to carefully substitute the values of $f(5)$ and $g$ into the expression and simplify step by step.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Calculate $f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 7$.
Step 2: Substitute $f(5)$ into $g(f(5) - 1)$ to get $g(7 - 1)$.
Step 3: Simplify to find $g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7$.
