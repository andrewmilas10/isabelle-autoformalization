  fixes x e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "x + e = 7"
    and h1 : "2 * x + e = 3"
  shows "e=11 \<and> x= (-4)"
proof -
  (* First, $x = 2x + e - (x + e) = 3 - 7 = -4$. *)
  have c0: "x = 2*x + e - (x + e)" using h0 h1
    sledgehammer
  then have "x = -4" sledgehammer
  (* Then, substituting $x=-4$ in $x+e=7$, we obtain $e=11$. *)
  have "e = 7 - x" using h0
    sledgehammer
  then have "e = 11" using c0
    sledgehammer
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
