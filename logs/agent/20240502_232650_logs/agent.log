I'm glad to help with the formal Isabelle proof based on the translated informal solution you provided. Here is the sketch of the proof:

```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_35:
  fixes k :: nat
  assumes "k^2 = 196"
  shows "(\<Sum> k \<in> { n ::nat. n dvd k}. k) = (24::nat)"
proof -
  (* Calculate $\sqrt{196}=\sqrt{2^2\cdot7^2}=2\cdot7$. *)
  have "k^2 = (2 * 7)^2" using assms(1) by simp
  then have c0: "k = 2 * 7" by simp
  (* The sum of the four positive factors is $1+2+7+14=24$. *)
  have "(\<Sum> d \<in> { n ::nat. n dvd k}. d) = 1 + 2 + 7 + 14" using c0 by simp
  then show ?thesis by simp

```

In this Isabelle proof sketch, the informal solution has been translated into a formal proof that calculates the sum of four positive factors of the positive integer square root of 196, which is shown to be 24. The step-by-step logic of the informal solution has been converted into an Isabelle proof using appropriate Isabelle syntax and steps.

The sum of two nonzero real numbers is 4 times their product. What is the sum of the reciprocals of the two numbers?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 12$ Show that it is \textbf{C}.

### Solution

Let $x, y$ be our two numbers. Then $x+y = 4xy$. Thus, 

$ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = 4$.
