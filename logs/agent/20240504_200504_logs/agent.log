---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key in this problem is to carefully simplify the complex expressions by combining like terms.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the given values to rewrite the expression as $(9-4i) - (-3-4i)$.
Step 2: Simplify the expression to get $9-4i + 3 + 4i$.
Step 3: Combine like terms to simplify further to get $12$ as the result.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0: "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1: "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Substitute the given values to rewrite the expression as $(9-4i) - (-3-4i)$. *)
  have "q - e = Complex 9 (-4) - Complex (-3) (-4)"
    using h0 h1
    sledgehammer
  (* Step 2: Simplify the expression to get $9-4i + 3 + 4i$. *)
  then have "q - e = Complex (9 + 3) ((-4) + 4)"
    by simp
  (* Step 3: Combine like terms to simplify further to get $12$ as the result. *)
  then show "q - e = 12"
    by simp
qed
However, you encountered an error at step 2. The last few statements you wrote up to the error were ['then', 'have "q - e = Complex (9 + 3) ((-4) + 4)"', 'by simp']. Isabelle gave the following reason for the error:
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. q - e = Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) \<Longrightarrow> Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) = Complex 12 0
At command "by" (line 1)
Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and new comment

----------------Fixed Proof-------------------
Here is the revised proof with the fix incorporated at the problematic step:

```isabelle
(* Step 1: Substitute the given values to rewrite the expression as (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i). *)
have "q - e = Complex 9 (-4) - Complex (-3) (-4)"
  using h0 h1
  by simp

(* Step 2: Simplify the expression to get 9 - 4i + 3 + 4i. *)
have "q - e = Complex (9 + 3) ((-4) + 4)"
  by simp

(* Step 3: Combine like terms to simplify further to get 12 as the result. *)
then show "q - e = 12"
  by simp
```

This revised version should resolve the error encountered during the proof.
