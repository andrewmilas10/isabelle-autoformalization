---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"


## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, we are dealing with complex numbers, so be careful with the manipulation of real and imaginary parts.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the given complex numbers $q$ and $e$.
Step 2: Compute $q - e = (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to get $(9 + 3) + (-4i + 4i)$.
Step 4: Finally, simplify to show that $q - e = 12$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Substitute the given complex numbers q and e. *)
  have q_def: "q = 9 - 4 * \<i>"
    using h0
    sledgehammer
  have e_def: "e = -3 - 4 * \<i>"
    using h1
    sledgehammer

  (* Step 2: Compute q - e = (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i). *)
  have "q - e = (9 - 4 * \<i>) - (-3 - 4 * \<i>)"
    using q_def e_def
    sledgehammer

  (* Step 3: Simplify the expression to get (9 + 3) + (-4i + 4i). *)
  also have "... = 12 + (-4 * \<i> + 4 * \<i>)"
    by auto
  also have "... = 12"
    by auto

  (* Step 4: Finally, simplify to show that q - e = 12. *)
  finally show ?thesis
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['have q_def: "q = 9 - 4 * \\<i>"', 'using h0', 'normalhammer']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments

## Reason
Step error: Outer syntax error (line 1): command expected,
but identifier Timeout (line 1) was found
At command "<malformed>" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
