---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

### Solution

We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$*)

Formal:
theorem algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2:
  fixes a b c :: complex
  assumes h0 : "a+b = 2*c"
    and h1 : "c = \<i>"
  shows "a*c+b*c=-2"
