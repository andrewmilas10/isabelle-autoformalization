---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to simply combine like terms carefully to obtain the correct answer. Make sure to show the addition and subtraction of the real and imaginary parts separately.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the given complex numbers $q = 9-4i$ and $e = -3-4i$.
Step 2: Perform the subtraction $(9-4i)- (-3-4i)$, which simplifies to $9-4i + 3 + 4i$.
Step 3: Combine like terms to get $(9+3) + (-4i+4i)$.
Step 4: Simplify further to obtain the final result $12$.

proof -
  (* Step 1: Substitute the given complex numbers $q = 9-4i$ and $e = -3-4i$. *)
  have "q = 9 - 4 * \<i>"
    using h0
    sledgehammer
  have "e = -3 - 4 * \<i>"
    using h1
    sledgehammer

  (* Step 2: Perform the subtraction $(9-4i)- (-3-4i)$, which simplifies to $9-4i + 3 + 4i$. *)
  have "q - e = (9 - 4 * \<i>) - (-3 - 4 * \<i>)"
    using h0 h1
    sledgehammer
  also have "... = 9 + 3 + (-4 * \<i> + 4 * \<i>)"
    sledgehammer

  (* Step 3: Combine like terms to get $(9+3) + (-4i+4i)$. *)
  also have "... = 12"
    sledgehammer

  (* Step 4: Simplify further to obtain the final result $12$. *)
