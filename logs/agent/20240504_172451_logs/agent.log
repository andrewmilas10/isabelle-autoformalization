---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/test/mathd_numbertheory_451.json) ------------------------------------
A positive integer $n$ is nice if there is a positive integer $m$ with exactly four positive divisors (including $1$ and $m$) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to $n.$ Find the sum of all the nice numbers in the set $\{ 2010,2011,2012,\dots,2019 \}.$ Show that it is 2016.

## Informal proof
The positive integers with exactly four positive divisors are the integers of the form $p^3$, where $p$ is a prime, or $p \cdot q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. We consider each case:

Suppose that $m = p^3$ for some prime $p$. Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + p^2 + p^3.$ For $p = 11,$ this value of $m$ is too low, and for $p = 13,$ the value of $m$ is too high; therefore, no prime $p$ gives a value of $n$ in the given set.

Therefore, we must have $m = p \cdot q$, for some distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + q + pq$, which we can factor as $(1+p)(1+q)$. First suppose that one of $p$ and $q$ equals $2$; without loss of generality, let $p = 2$. Then $(1+p)(1+q) = 3(1+q).$ Since $q \neq p = 2$, we see that $q$ is odd, and so $1+q$ is even. Thus $3(1+q)$ is divisible by $6,$ so it must be either $2010$ or $2016.$ Trying both cases, we see that both $3(1+q) = 2010$ and $3(1 + q) = 2016$ give a non-prime value of $q.$

If neither $p$ nor $q$ equals $2$, then both are odd primes, so $(1+p)(1+q)$ is the product of two even numbers, which must be divisible by $4.$ The only multiples of $4$ in the given range are $2012$ and $2016$.  We have $2012 = 2^2 \cdot 503,$ so the only way to write $2012$ as the product of two even positive integers is $2012 = 2 \cdot 1006.$ But we cannot have $1+p=2$ or $1+q=2$, since $2-1=1$ is not prime.  Note that $2016 = (1 + 3)(1 + 503).$  Since both 3 and 503 are prime, 2016 is nice.

Thus, $2016$ is the only nice number in the given set.

Step 4: Assume one of $p$ or $q$ equals 2. Evaluate $(1+p)(1+q)$ to simplify the problem.
Step 5: Investigate the cases where neither $p$ nor $q$ equals 2. Discuss the divisibility by 4 based on the values $4$, $6$, $2012$, and $2016.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 9)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem requires careful consideration of different cases for the number with exactly four divisors and analyzing the sums of divisors to determine which numbers are nice. It involves prime factorization and understanding the conditions for a number to have exactly four divisors.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 9
Step 1: Identify the types of numbers with exactly four divisors as either of the form $p^3$ or $p \cdot q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.
Step 2: Consider the case when $m = p^3$ and analyze the sum of divisors for primes $p = 11$ and $p = 13$ within the given set.
Step 3: Analyze the case when $m = p \cdot q$, examining the sum of divisors as $(1+p)(1+q)$.
Step 4: Explore the scenario where one of $p$ or $q$ equals $2$ and assess the possible values for $n$.
Step 5: Investigate the case where neither $p$ nor $q$ equals $2$ and determine the implications for the sum of divisors.
Step 6: Conclude that the only nice number in the set $\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}$ is $2016$ and sum up all the nice numbers to get a total of 2016.

---------------------New Problem (2: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_332.json) ------------------------------------
Real numbers $x$ and $y$ have an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of $\sqrt{19}$. Find $x^2+y^2$. Show that it is 158.

## Informal proof
The givens tell us that $\frac{x+y}{2}=7$ and $\sqrt{xy}=\sqrt{19}$, or $x+y=14$ and $xy=19$. $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$, so  \[
x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=14^2-2\cdot19=196-38=158
\]

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_332:
  fixes x y ::real
  assumes "(x + y) / 2 = 7"
    and "sqrt (x * y) = sqrt 19" 
  shows "x^2 * y^2 = 158"

---------------------New Problem (3: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_293.json) ------------------------------------
Calculate $\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.

Note: When entering a square root with more than one character, you must use parentheses or brackets.  For example, you should enter $\sqrt{14}$ as "sqrt(14)" or "sqrt{14}". Show that it is 36x \sqrt{35x}.

## Informal proof
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is  \begin{align*}
&\sqrt{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot x^3} \\
& \qquad = \sqrt{(3^4 \cdot 2^4 \cdot x^2) \cdot (5 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} \\
& \qquad = 36x \sqrt{35x}.
\end{align*}

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_293:
  fixes x :: real 
  shows "sqrt (60 * x) * sqrt (12 * x) * sqrt (63 * x) 
                = 36 * x * sqrt (35 * x)"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 8)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this case, understanding the prime factorization of the expressions is crucial to simplifying the square roots. We can proceed by simplifying each square root and then combining them to express the answer in the desired form.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Write out the prime factorization of the expression inside the square roots: $\sqrt{60x} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot x}$. Simplify this to $6\sqrt{10x}$.
Step 2: Repeat this process for $\sqrt{12x}$ and $\sqrt{63x}$, noticing they simplify to $6\sqrt{2x}$ and $3\sqrt{7x}$, respectively.
Step 3: Combine the simplified square roots to get $6\sqrt{10x} \cdot 6\sqrt{2x} \cdot 3\sqrt{7x}$.
Step 4: Combine the constants outside the square roots to get $36x$.
Step 5: Combine the remaining square roots to get $\sqrt{10 \cdot 2 \cdot 7 \cdot x^3} = \sqrt{140x^3} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 35} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} = 2\sqrt{35}x$.
Step 6: Therefore, the final answer is $36x\sqrt{35x}$.

---------------------New Problem (4: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_170.json) ------------------------------------
How many integers are in the solution set of $|x-2|\leq5.6$ ? Show that it is 11.

## Informal proof
Getting rid of the absolute value, we have $-5.6 \le x-2 \le 5.6$, or $-3.6 \le x \le 7.6$. Thus, $x$ can be any integer from -3 to 7, inclusive. There are $7-(-3)+1=11$ integers in this range.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_170:
  "card { n::int. abs (n - 2) \<le> 5 + 6 / 10} = 11"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-04 17:44:07,065 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: When formalizing, be attentive to the definition of the set in Isabelle and ensure it aligns with the solution set described in the informal proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Translate the absolute value inequality $|x-2|\leq5.6$ into the equivalent form $-5.6 \le x-2 \le 5.6$.
Step 2: Simplify the inequality to get $-3.6 \le x \le 7.6$.
Step 3: Recognize that this range allows $x$ to take any integer value from -3 to 7, inclusive.
Step 4: Determine the count of integers in this range as $7-(-3)+1=11$, thus proving there are 11 integers in the solution set.
