---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"


## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, the key is to carefully handle the addition and subtraction of complex numbers. We need to ensure that the real and imaginary parts are treated separately.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the given complex numbers $q$ and $e$ as $9-4i$ and $-3-4i$ respectively.
Step 2: Perform the subtraction as $(9-4i)- (-3-4i)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression step by step: $9-4i + 3 + 4i$.
Step 4: Combine like terms to get the final result as $12$.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:
theorem mathd_algebra_48:

    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"

However, you encountered an error at step 1 where, specifically, you wrote normalhammer. Isabelle gave the following reason for the error:
Step error: Outer syntax error (line 1): command expected,
but identifier Timeout (line 1) was found
At command "<malformed>" (line 1)
Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes
