---------------------New Problem (96: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2008_p4.json) ------------------------------------
Which of the following is equal to the [[product]]
$\frac{8}{4}\cdot\frac{12}{8}\cdot\frac{16}{12}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{4n+4}{4n}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{2008}{2004}?$

$\textbf{(A)}\ 251\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 502\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1004\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2008\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4016$ Show that it is \textbf{(B)}.

## Informal proof
$\frac {8}{4}\cdot\frac {12}{8}\cdot\frac {16}{12}\cdots\frac {4n + 4}{4n}\cdots\frac {2008}{2004} = \frac {1}{4}\cdot\left(\frac {8}{8}\cdot\frac {12}{12}\cdots\frac {4n}{4n}\cdots\frac {2004}{2004}\right)\cdot 2008 = \frac{2008}{4} =$ $502 \Rightarrow B$.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2008_p4:
  "(\<Prod>k::nat=1..501. ((4::real) * k + 4) / (4 * k)) = 502"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves carefully simplifying the product expression by recognizing common terms in the fractions being multiplied together. The key insight is to rewrite the product as a telescoping series. The formal proof will require precise algebraic manipulations to simplify the product expression.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Rewrite the product expression as $\frac {1}{4}\cdot\left(\frac {8}{8}\cdot\frac {12}{12}\cdots\frac {4n}{4n}\cdots\frac {2004}{2004}\right)\cdot 2008$.
Step 2: Recognize that each fraction $\frac {4n + 4}{4n}$ simplifies to $1 + \frac{1}{n}$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to get $\frac{2008}{4}$.
Step 4: Calculate the final result to show that it equals 502, thus proving that the answer is (B).

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements

## Reason

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Notes for Structured proof: The main idea here is to simplify the product and notice the telescoping effect that leads to the final result. We should ensure to expand the product in a clear and concise manner while keeping track of the pattern.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Rewrite the product as $\frac{8}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{8} \cdot \frac{16}{12} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{4n + 4}{4n} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{2008}{2004}$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Find the greatest common factor of 180 and 168. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
If a number $d$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, it must also divide into their difference. Thus, $d$ will be divisible by $180 - 168 = 12$. We notice that $12$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, so it follows that $12$ must be the GCF of $180$ and $168$.

Step 1: Find the difference between 180 and 168: $180 - 168 = 12$.
Step 2: Notice that any common divisor of 180 and 168 must divide 12 as well.
Step 3: Confirm that 12 is indeed a common divisor of 180 and 168.
Step 4: Conclude that the greatest common divisor of 180 and 168 is 12.

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (98: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_267.json) ------------------------------------
Solve for $x$: $\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \frac{x-2}{x+2}$ Show that it is 0.

## Informal proof
Cross-multiplying (which is the same as multiplying both sides by $x-1$ and by $x+2$) gives \[(x+1)(x+2) = (x-2)(x-1).\] Expanding the products on both sides gives  \[x^2 + 3x + 2 = x^2 -3x +2.\] Subtracting $x^2$ and 2 from both sides gives  $3x=-3x$, so $6x=0$ and $x=0$.

## Formal statement

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: Be cautious about dividing by zero at each step. Isabelle will require justification for such operations and assertions. It will also be important to consider additional assumptions about $x$ in the formal proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Start with the given equation: $\frac{x+1}{x-1} = \frac{x-2}{x+2}$.
Step 2: Cross-multiply to get $(x+1)(x+2) = (x-2)(x-1)$.
Step 3: Expand both sides to get $x^2 + 3x + 2 = x^2 - 3x + 2$.
Step 4: Simplify the equation to get $3x = -3x$.
Step 5: Combine like terms to get $6x = 0$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (99: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2010_p10.json) ------------------------------------
The first four terms of an arithmetic sequence are $p$, $9$, $3p-q$, and $3p+q$. What is the $2010^\text{th}$ term of this sequence?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 8041 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 8043 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 8045 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 8047 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 8049$ Show that it is \textbf{(A) }8041.

## Informal proof
$3p-q$ and $3p+q$ are consecutive terms, so the common difference is $(3p+q)-(3p-q) = 2q$.

$\begin{align*}p+2q &= 9\\
9+2q &= 3p-q\\
q&=2\\
p&=5\end{align*}$

The common difference is $4$. The first term is $5$ and the $2010^\text{th}$ term is

$5+4(2009) = \textbf{(A) }8041$

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2010_p10:
  fixes p q :: real
    and a :: "nat \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes h0 : "\<And>n. a (n+2) - a (n+1) = a (n+1) - a n"

    and h2 : "a 2 = 9"
    and h3 : "a 3 = 3 * p - q"
    and h4 : "a 4 = 3 * p + q"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-05 21:30:16,138 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key to solving this problem is to establish the common difference and the initial terms of the arithmetic sequence. Once these are determined, finding the $2010$th term is a matter of simple arithmetic.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Determine the common difference by noting that consecutive terms differ by $2q$.
Step 2: Solve the system of equations $p + 2q = 9$ and $9 + 2q = 3p - q$ to find $p = 5$ and $q = 2$.
Step 3: With the common difference and initial term known, find the $2010$th term using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.
Step 4: Calculate the $2010$th term by plugging in $n=2010$, $a_1=5$, and $d=4$ to get $a_{2010} = 5 + 4(2009) = 8041$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

  have common_diff: "a (3 + 1) - a 3 = a 3 - a 2"
    using h0
  from this have "a 4 - a 3 = a 3 - a 2"

  (* Step 2: Solve the system of equations $p + 2q = 9$ and $9 + 2q = 3p - q$ to find $p = 5$ and $q = 2$. *)

  then have "q = 2"
    by simp
  hence "3*p + q = a 4"
    using h4
  then have "p = 5"

  (* Step 3: With the common difference and initial term known, find the $2010$th term using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. *)
  hence "a 2010 = a 1 + 2009 * (a 2 - a 1)"

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (100: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_224.json) ------------------------------------
The square root of $t$ is greater than $2$ and less than $3.5$. How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition? Show that it is 8.

## Informal proof
We have: $2 < \sqrt{t} < \frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $8$ possible integer values of $t$.

Notes for Structured proof: When formalizing, it's important to consider how the square root inequality is squared and how the range for the integer values of $t$ is determined. It's also crucial to properly account for the inclusivity/exclusivity of the bounds.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Start with $2 < \sqrt{t} < \frac{7}{2}$.
Step 2: Square the inequality to get $4 < t < \frac{49}{4} = 12.25$.
Step 3: Determine the integer values of $t$ between 5 and 12 inclusive.

Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (101: data/full_data/valid/numbertheory_nckeqnm1ckpnm1ckm1.json) ------------------------------------
Show that for positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $k \leq n$, we have 
$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

## Informal proof
We have $\binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} = \frac{(n-k) (n-1)!}{k!(n-k)!} + \frac{k (n-1)!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
So $\binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \frac{((n-k) + k) (n-1)!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}$.

## Formal statement
theorem numbertheory_nckeqnm1ckpnm1ckm1:
  fixes n k ::nat
  assumes "0 < n \<and> 0 < k"
    and "k \<le> n"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: When translating to Isabelle, we need to be careful with the factorial notation and the binomial coefficient notation. The key steps involve expanding the binomial coefficients and simplifying them step by step.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Start with the expression $\binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.
Step 2: Substitute the factorial definitions to get $\frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!}$.
Step 3: Combine the fractions to obtain a common denominator and simplify to $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.
Step 4: Recognize that this simplifies to $\binom{n}{k}$, which completes the proof.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (102: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_169.json) ------------------------------------
What is the greatest common factor of $20 !$ and $200,\!000$?  (Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.) Show that it is 40,\!000.

## Informal proof
The prime factorization of $200,000$ is $2^6 \cdot 5^5$. Then count the number of factors of $2$ and $5$ in $20!$. Since there are $10$ even numbers, there are more than $6$ factors of $2$. There are $4$ factors of $5$. So the greatest common factor is $2^6 \cdot 5^4=40,\!000$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_169:
  "gcd (fact 20) 200000 = (40000::nat)"

Notes for Structured proof: We need to carefully consider the prime factorization of both numbers and the factors of 2 and 5 in $20!$. Additionally, we need to accurately calculate the highest power of 2 and 5 that can divide both numbers.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Determine the prime factorization of $200,000$ as $2^6 \cdot 5^5$.
Step 2: Count the factors of 2 and 5 in $20!$. Since there are $10$ even numbers, there are more than $6$ factors of 2 and $4$ factors of 5.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

For a natural number $n$, show that $3 \mid (2^{2n+1}+1)$.

## Informal proof
By induction, the base case for $n=0$ is true since $3 \mid 2+ 1 = 3$.
Assuming the property holds at $n$, let $k$ be the positive integer such that $3k=2^{2n+1}+1$
Then,  $2^{2(n+1)+1}+1=4.2^{2n+1} + 1 = 4(3k-1)+1=3(4k-1)$.
Since 4k-1 > 0, we have showed the property at $n+1$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: The informal proof uses mathematical induction, so it will require establishing the base case and then proving the inductive step. The focus should be on explicitly showing how the induction step follows from the assumption that the property holds for $n$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Base case: Show that for $n=0$, $3$ divides $2^{2*0+1} + 1 = 3$.
Step 2: Inductive step: Assume that there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $3k = 2^{2n+1} + 1$ for some $n$. Then show that $3$ divides $2^{2(n+1)+1} + 1 = 3(4k-1)$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (104: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_84.json) ------------------------------------
What is the digit in the hundredths place of the decimal equivalent of $\frac{9}{160}$? Show that it is 5.

## Informal proof
Since the denominator of $\dfrac{9}{160}$ is $2^5\cdot5$, we multiply numerator and denominator by $5^4$ to obtain  \[
\frac{9}{160} = \frac{9\cdot 5^4}{2^5\cdot 5\cdot 5^4} = \frac{9\cdot 625}{10^5} = \frac{5625}{10^5} = 0.05625.
\]So, the digit in the hundredths place is $5$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_84:
  "floor ((9::real) / 160 * 100) = (5::int)"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves converting a fraction to a decimal and determining a specific digit place. The key step is multiplying by a suitable power of 10 to move the desired digit to the hundredths place.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Identify the denominator of $\frac{9}{160}$ as $2^5 \cdot 5$.
Step 2: Multiply the numerator and denominator by $5^4$ to get $\frac{5625}{10^5}$.
Step 3: Simplify to $\frac{5625}{10^5} = 0.05625$.
Step 4: The digit in the hundredths place of $0.05625$ is $5$.

If $f(x)=4x^3+1$, find $f^{-1}(33)$. Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
If we substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$ we get  \[f(f^{-1}(x))=4(f^{-1}(x))^3+1.\]This reduces to  \[x=4(f^{-1}(x))^3+1.\]If we solve for $f^{-1}(x)$, we find that $f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{\frac{x-1}{4}}$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(33)=\sqrt[3]{\frac{33-1}{4}}=\sqrt[3]8=2$.

## Formal statement

Notes for Structured proof: When dealing with inverse functions in Isabelle, it's important to use the Hilbert Choice operator for inverses. Also, careful substitution and solving are needed to find the correct result.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into the expression for $f$ to get $f(f^{-1}(x)) = 4(f^{-1}(x))^3 + 1$.
Step 2: Simplify to get $x = 4(f^{-1}(x))^3 + 1$.
Step 3: Solve for $f^{-1}(x)$ to obtain $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{x-1}{4}}$.
Step 4: Calculate $f^{-1}(33)$ by substituting $x = 33$ to get $f^{-1}(33) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{33-1}{4}} = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key to this problem is leveraging the definition of the inverse function and manipulating the given expression to solve for $f^{-1}(x)$. Note the use of the bijection assumption.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Substitute $f^{-1}(x)$ into the expression for $f$ to get $f(f^{-1}(x)) = 4(f^{-1}(x))^3 + 1$.
Step 2: Simplify the above equation to obtain $x = 4(f^{-1}(x))^3 + 1$.
Step 3: Solve for $f^{-1}(x)$ to find $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{x-1}{4}}$.
Step 4: Substitute $x = 33$ to find $f^{-1}(33) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{33-1}{4}} = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (106: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_198.json) ------------------------------------
What is the tens digit of $5^{2005}$? Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
Note that for $n\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\equiv 25 \pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\equiv 25\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\cdot 5^{n-1}\equiv 5\cdot 25 \equiv 125 \equiv 25 \pmod{100}$. Thus the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is $2$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_198:
  "(5^2005) mod 100 = (25::nat)"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-05 22:59:26,078 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key idea here is to establish a pattern with the last two digits of powers of 5, which simplifies the problem significantly. It is essential to highlight the modulo 100 pattern and justify why the tens digit remains 2 for $5^{2005}$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Show that the last two digits of $5^2$ is 25, i.e., $5^2 \equiv 25 \pmod{100}$.
Step 2: Use the pattern established and prove that for $n\geq 2$, $5^n \equiv 25 \pmod{100}$ if $5^{n-1} \equiv 25 \pmod{100}$.
Step 3: Conclude by showing that for $n=2005$, the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is 2.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (108: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_284.json) ------------------------------------
What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits? Show that it is 18.

## Informal proof
Let the tens digit of the two-digit integer be $a$ and let its units digit be $b$.  The equation \[
10a+b=2(a+b)
\] is given.  Distributing on the right-hand side and subtracting $2a+b$ from both sides gives $8a=b$.  Since $8a>9$ for any digit $a>1$, we have $a=1$, $b=8$, and $10a+b=18$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_284:
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: When formalizing the problem, it's important to ensure the constraints on the digits of the number are clear in each step. The key here is to carefully manipulate the equation to solve for the values of $a$ and $b$ and then find the two-digit integer.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Write the equation $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ explicitly.
Step 2: Distribute on the right-hand side and simplify to get $8a = b$.
Step 3: Note that $8a > 9$ for any $a > 1$, hence $a = 1$.
Step 4: Substitute $a = 1$ back into $8a = b$ to find $b = 8$.
Step 5: Therefore, the two-digit integer is $10a + b = 18$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Notes for Structured proof: When formalizing, ensure to explicitly state the range of values for the variables and how the equation simplifies step by step to the final result. It's important to justify why $a=1$ and $b=8$ based on the given constraints.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Start with the equation $10a+b=2(a+b)$.
Step 2: Distribute on the right-hand side to get $10a+b=2a+2b$.
Step 3: Rearrange the equation to simplify to $8a=b$.
Step 4: Since $b$ is a digit, $8a$ must be in the form of a two-digit integer, leading to $a=1$ and $b=8$.
Step 5: Therefore, $10a+b=18$, showing that the positive two-digit integer is 18.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (109: data/full_data/valid/induction_divisibility_9div10tonm1.json) ------------------------------------
Show that 9 divides $10^n - 1$ for any natural number n.

## Informal proof
We use induction. The base case for $n=0$  is true since $9 \mid 0$.
Assume the result is true for some $n \geq 0$. Then $9\mid 10^n - 1$, and there exists $k$ such that $10^n - 1$ = 9k.
Finally, rewriting $10^{n+1}-1 = 10*(10^n - 1) + 9=9 * (10*k+1)$, which implies the result for $n+1$.

## Formal statement

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This proof involves using mathematical induction. The base case must be explicitly checked, and the induction hypothesis used to prove for the next case.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Base case: Show that $9 \mid 10^0 - 1$.
Step 2: Inductive step: Assume $9 \mid 10^n - 1$ for some $n \geq 0$.
Step 3: Using the induction hypothesis, express $10^n - 1 = 9k$ for some integer $k$.
Step 4: Rewrite $10^{n+1} - 1 = 10 * (10^n - 1) + 9$.
Step 5: Substitute $10^n - 1 = 9k$ into the expression to show that $10^{n+1} - 1$ is divisible by 9.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (110: data/full_data/valid/aime_1996_p5.json) ------------------------------------
Suppose that the [[root]]s of $x^3+3x^2+4x-11=0$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$, and that the roots of $x^3+rx^2+sx+t=0$ are $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$. Find $t$. Show that it is 23.

## Informal proof
By [[Vieta's formulas]] on the polynomial $P(x) = x^3+3x^2+4x-11 = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = 0$, we have $a + b + c = s = -3$, $ab + bc + ca = 4$, and $abc = 11$. Then
<center>$t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = -(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) = -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)$</center>
This is just the definition for $-P(-3) = 023$.

## Formal statement

  fixes a b c r s t :: real
    and f g :: "real \<Rightarrow> real"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves using Vieta's formulas and manipulating expressions based on the roots of the given polynomials. We will need to carefully apply Vieta's formulas and substitution to find the value of $t$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Apply Vieta's formulas on the polynomial $x^3+3x^2+4x-11=0$ to get $a+b+c=-3$, $ab+bc+ca=4$, and $abc=11$.
Step 2: Use these relationships to express $t$ as $t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to find $t = -P(-3)$.
Step 4: Evaluate $P(-3) = 23$ to conclude the proof.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves applying Vieta's formulas and simplifying the expression for the coefficient $t$ in terms of the roots $a$, $b$, and $c$. The key steps will involve careful substitution and simplification of expressions.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: Apply Vieta's formulas to the polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 11$ to obtain the relationships $a + b + c = -3$, $ab + bc + ca = 4$, and $abc = 11$.
Step 2: Express $t$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the formula $t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = -(-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to find $t = 23$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

In a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form. Show that it is 187.5.

## Informal proof
We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\frac{125}{8}=\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\left(\frac{125}{8}\right)(12)=187.5$ calories.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_104:

  assumes h0 : "125/8 = x /12"
  shows "x = 375/2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key idea is to set up the proportion correctly and solve for the unknown calories in the 12 fluid ounce bottle.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Set up the proportion $\frac{125}{8} = \frac{x}{12}$ based on the given information.
Step 2: Solve for $x$ by cross-multiplying to get $x = \left(\frac{125}{8}\right)(12) = \frac{375}{2}$.
Step 3: Thus, the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle is $\frac{375}{2} = 187.5$.

For how many positive integers $n$ is $n^2 - 3n + 2$ a [[prime]] number?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \text{none}
\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}
\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \text{two}
\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \text{more\ than\ two,\ but\ finitely\ many}
\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{infinitely\ many}$ Show that it is \mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}.

## Informal proof
Factoring, we get $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-2)(n-1)$. Either $n-1$ or $n-2$ is odd, and the other is even.  Their product must yield an even number.  The only prime that is even is $2$, which is when $n$ is $3$ or $0$. Since $0$ is not a positive number, the answer is $\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}$.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key to this problem is in careful observation of the factors and the properties of primes, specifically the fact that a prime number must be greater than 1 and have exactly two factors. This will be important to keep in mind when structuring the steps for Isabelle.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Factorize the expression $n^2 - 3n + 2$ to get $(n-2)(n-1)$.
Step 2: Consider the properties of the factors $(n-1)$ and $(n-2)$ in relation to being odd and even.
Step 3: Understand that the product of an odd number and an even number is always even.
Step 4: Realize that for the expression to be a prime, one of the factors must be $1$ or $-1$.
Step 5: Analyze that since $-1$ is not a positive integer, the only possibility is when one of the factors equals $1$, leading to $n=3$.
Step 6: Verify that $n=3$ indeed satisfies the conditions, completing the proof that there is only one positive integer $n$ for which the expression is prime.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves analyzing the factors of the quadratic equation and the properties of primes to determine the possible values for $n$. We need to carefully consider the parity of factors and the uniqueness of the prime factorization.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Factor the quadratic equation to get $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-2)(n-1)$.
Step 2: Analyze the parity of $(n-1)$ and $(n-2)$, noting that one must be even and the other odd.
Step 3: Recognize that the product of an even number and an odd number is always even.
Step 4: Since the prime factor is even (which is only possible for the prime $2$), determine the possible values for $n$ to be $3$ or $0$.
Step 5: Confirm that $0$ is not a positive integer, leading to the conclusion that $n$ must be $3$, resulting in the solution being $\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (113: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_405.json) ------------------------------------
For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the sum $x^2+4x+4$ less than 20? Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
Note that since we can only use positive integers for $x$, the minimum will be x = 1.  Testing x = 2, we get $2^2 + 4\cdot 2 + 4 = 16$.  Since $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, we know that only $x = 1,2$ will work, thus, there are $2$ positive integer values of $x$ such that this function is less than 20.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_405:
  fixes x :: nat
  assumes h0 : "0 < x"
    and h1 : "x ^ 2 + 4 * x + 4 < 20"
  shows "x = 1 \<or> x = 2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We need to focus on examining the given inequality for different positive integer values of $x$ and reasoning about their outcomes in respect to the sum being less than 20.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Start with the minimum positive integer value of $x$, which is $1$, and substitute it into the inequality $x^2 + 4x + 4 < 20$.
Step 2: Calculate the sum for $x = 1$, which gives $1^2+4\cdot1+4 = 9 < 20$.
Step 3: Proceed to the next positive integer, which is $2$, and substitute it into the inequality to get $2^2+4\cdot2+4 = 16 < 20$.
Step 4: Observe the difference between sums for $x = 2$ and $x = 1$ to see that $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, which suggests only $x = 1, 2$ work.
Step 5: Conclude that there are $2$ positive integer values of $x$ for which the sum is less than 20.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Step 2: Move on to $x=2$ and compute $2^2 + 4 \cdot 2 + 4 = 16$.
Step 3: Note that $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, indicating that $x=3$ is too large and will exceed 20.
Step 4: Conclude that only $x=1$ and $x=2$ satisfy the condition, leading to a total of 2 positive integer values of $x$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (114: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_301.json) ------------------------------------
If $j$ is a positive integer and the expression $(7j+3)$ is multiplied by 3 and then divided by 7, what is the remainder? Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
First we multiply $(7j+3)$ by 3 to get $21j+9$. Now we divide by 7 and get $$\frac{21j+9}{7}=3j+\frac{9}{7}=3j+1+\frac{2}{7}.$$ Since $j$ is an integer, we know that $3j+1$ is also an integer. We're left with the fraction $\frac{2}{7}$ when we divided by 7, which means the remainder is $2$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_301:
  fixes j :: nat 
  assumes "j>0"
  shows "(3 * (7 * j + 3)) mod 7 = 2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key step here is to carefully perform the multiplication and division while keeping track of remainders.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Multiply $(7j+3)$ by 3 to get $21j+9$.
Step 2: Divide $21j+9$ by 7 to get $3j+1+\frac{2}{7}$.
Step 3: Recognize that $3j+1$ is an integer.
Step 4: Identify the fraction leftover as $\frac{2}{7}$, indicating the remainder is 2.

By expansion, we have that $(a-d)(a-c) = a^2-ad-ac+cd$, so $(a-d)(a-c)(a-b) = (a^2-ad-ac+cd)(a-b) = a^3-da^2-ca^2+acd-ba^2+abd+abc-bcd$
As a result, $-(((a^2 - (b+c)a) + cb)d) + (a^2 - (b+c)a + cb)a = -d(a^2-ab-ac+bc)+a^3-ba^2-ca^2+abc = a^3-da^2-ca^2+acd-ba^2+abd+abc-bcd = (a-d)(a-c)(a-b)$.

## Formal statement

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This proof involves expanding the given expressions and then simplifying to show they are equal. It requires careful handling of the complex numbers and keeping track of all the terms while expanding.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: Expand $(a-d)(a-c)$ to get $a^2-ad-ac+cd$.
Step 2: Multiply this by $(a-b)$ to obtain the expression for $(a-d)(a-c)(a-b)$.
Step 3: Expand the expression $-(((a^2 - (b+c)a) + cb)d)$ to obtain $-d(a^2-ab-ac+bc)$.
Step 4: Similarly, expand $(a^2 - (b+c)a + cb)a$ to get $a^3-ba^2-ca^2+abc$.
Step 5: Compare the expanded forms to show that they are equal, confirming the given equation.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key to this proof is to carefully expand and simplify the expressions step by step to show the equality. Make sure to keep track of each term and maintain clarity in the manipulation.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: Expand $(a-d)(a-c)$ to get $a^2-ad-ac+cd$.
Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by $(a-b)$ to get the expanded form $(a^2-ad-ac+cd)(a-b)$.
Step 3: Expand and simplify the result from Step 2 to obtain $a^3-da^2-ca^2+acd-ba^2+abd+abc-bcd$.
Step 4: Expand the expression $-(((a^2 - (b+c)a) + cb)d) + (a^2 - (b+c)a + cb)a$ to get $-d(a^2-ab-ac+bc)+a^3-ba^2-ca^2+abc$.
Step 5: Simplify the expression from Step 4 to obtain $a^3-da^2-ca^2+acd-ba^2+abd+abc-bcd$.
Step 6: Clearly state and conclude that the two expressions obtained in Steps 3 and 5 are equal, hence proving the desired equality.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (116: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_780.json) ------------------------------------
Suppose $m$ is a two-digit positive integer such that $6^{-1}\pmod m$ exists and $6^{-1}\equiv 6^2\pmod m$. What is $m$? Show that it is 43.

## Informal proof
We can multiply both sides of the congruence $6^{-1}\equiv 6^2\pmod m$ by $6$: $$
\underbrace{6\cdot 6^{-1}}_1 \equiv \underbrace{6\cdot 6^2}_{6^3} \pmod m.
$$Thus $6^3-1=215$ is a multiple of $m$. We know that $m$ has two digits. The only two-digit positive divisor of $215$ is $43$, so $m=43$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_780:
  fixes m x :: nat
  assumes h0 : "10 \<le> m"
    and h1 : "m \<le> 99"
    and h2 : "(6 * x) mod m = 1"
    and h3 : "(x - 6^2) mod m = 0"
  shows "m = 43"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-06 06:38:55,101 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to carefully manipulate the congruences and express $m$ in terms of known values like $6$ and $215$. It is crucial to ensure the steps are logically sound and lead to the conclusion that $m=43$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Multiply both sides of the congruence $(6 \cdot x) \mod m = 1$ by $6$ to get $(6 \cdot 6 \cdot x) \equiv (6 \cdot 6^2) \pmod m$.
Step 2: Simplify the congruence to $6^3 \equiv 6^3 \pmod m$, which leads to $6^3 - 1 \equiv 6^3 \pmod m$.
Step 3: Consequently, $6^3 - 1$ is a multiple of $m$, implying $6^3 - 1 = 215 = 5 \cdot 43$ is a multiple of $m$.
Step 4: Since $m$ is a two-digit positive integer, it follows that $m = 43$ as it is the only two-digit divisor of $215$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, we need to carefully manipulate the congruences to find the correct multiple of $m$. The main steps will involve multiplying by 6 and using the given conditions to arrive at the factored multiple. Since we are given constraints on $m$ being a two-digit positive integer, we can easily deduce the value of $m$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Multiply $6^{-1}\equiv 6^2\pmod{m}$ by 6 to get $6^3\equiv 1\pmod{m}$.
Step 2: This implies $m$ divides $6^3 - 1 = 215$.
Step 3: Since $m$ is a two-digit positive integer, the only divisor of 215 in that range is 43.
Step 4: Thus, $m=43$.

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

If $321_{b}$ is equal to the base 10 integer 57, find $b$ given that $b>0$. Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Converting $321_{b}$ to base 10 and setting it equal to 57, we find that  \begin{align*} 3(b^2)+2(b^1)+1(b^0)&=57
\\ 3b^2+2b+1&=57
\\\Rightarrow\qquad 3b^2+2b-56&=0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (3b+14)(b-4)&=0
\end{align*}This tells us that $b$ is either $-\frac{14}{3}$ or $4$. We know that $b>0$, so $b=4$.

## Formal statement

Notes for Structured proof: In this case, we are working with natural numbers, so the solutions must also be natural. It's crucial to explicitly mention that while we solve for $b$, only the positive solution is valid due to the assumption $b>0$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Given the equation $3b^2 + 2b + 1 = 57$, factor it to get $(3b + 14)(b - 4) = 0$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

In the fixed proof, I simplified Step 1 by replacing `sledgehammer` with `simp` to avoid timing out. I also added a proof within Step 2 that uses the distributive property to factor the quadratic equation and prove the required equality.

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{7}{15} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{7}{8} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{8}{7} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{15}{8} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{15}{7}$ Show that it is \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{8}{7}.

## Informal proof
This problem is quickly solved with knowledge of the laws of exponents and logarithms.

$\begin{align*} 7^{x+7} &= 8^x \\
 7^x*7^7 &= 8^x \\
 \left(\frac{8}{7}\right)^x &= 7^7 \\
 x &= \log_{8/7}7^7 \end{align*}$

Since we are looking for the base of the logarithm, our answer is $\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{8}{7}$.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2010_p11:
  fixes x b :: real
  assumes "0 < b"
    and "7 powr (x + 7) = 8 powr x"
    and "x = ln (7^7) / ln b" 
  shows "b = 8 / 7"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The informal proof utilizes exponent rules and logarithms to simplify the equation. Be mindful of the properties of logarithms and ensure these are correctly represented in the formal proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Start with the given equation $7^{x+7} = 8^x$.
Step 2: Rewrite the equation using the properties of exponents to get $\left(\frac{8}{7}\right)^x = 7^7$.
Step 3: Solve for $x$ to obtain $x = \log_{\frac{8}{7}} 7^7$.
Step 4: The problem asks for the value of $b$, which is the base of the logarithm, hence $b = \frac{8}{7}$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Three plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number.  What is the number? Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\dfrac{1}{x} = \dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = 2$.

Show that for positive integer n, $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1$.

## Informal proof
We use induction. The base case for $n=1$ states 2*0+3 = 2^2-1 which is true. Assuming the result holds for $n\geq 0$, write $\sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 3) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) + 2*n+3 = (n+1)^2 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 4n + 4 - 1 = (n+2)^2 -1$. This shows the result holds for $n+1$ and concludes the proof by induction.

Step 2: Assume the result holds for $n\geq 0$ and show the induction step: $\sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 3) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) + 2*n+3 = (n+1)^2 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 4n + 4 - 1 = (n+2)^2 -1$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Incorrect Proof
theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1:
  fixes n :: nat 
  shows "(\<Sum> k<n. 2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1"
proof (induction n)
  (* Step 1: Show the base case for $n=1$: $2*0+3 = 2^2-1$. *)
  case 0
  then show ?case
    by simp

  (* Step 2: Assume the result holds for $n\geq 0$ and show the induction step: 
     $\sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 3) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) + 2*n+3 = (n+1)^2 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 4n + 4 - 1 = (n+2)^2 -1$. *)
  case (Suc n)
  then show ?case
    by (simp add: sum_atMost_Suc algebra_simps)
qed

## Last Statements
['then', 'show ?case', 'by (simp add: sum_atMost_Suc algebra_simps)']
In Step 2 of the proof's comments

## Reason
Step error: Undefined fact: "sum_atMost_Suc" (line 1)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

``` 

I have simplified the induction step in the proof by removing the usage of the "sum_atMost_Suc" fact that was causing an error. The key steps and logic remain the same, but unnecessary details have been removed to make the proof easier to apply.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: Induction proofs can be straightforward to formalize when the steps are broken down properly. We need to ensure that the base case and induction step are clearly outlined and explained.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Start with the base case for n=1: $\sum_{k=0}^{1-1} (2k + 3) = 2*0 + 3 = 2^2 - 1$ which is true.
Step 2: Assume the result holds for some arbitrary $n \geq 0$. This is the induction hypothesis.
Step 3: Use the induction hypothesis to expand $\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k + 3)$ into $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 3) + 2n + 3$.
Step 4: Simplify the expression to obtain $(n + 1)^2 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - 1 + 2n + 3 = n^2 + 4n + 4 - 1 = (n + 2)^2 - 1$.
Step 5: Conclude that the result holds for $n+1$ and hence by induction, the original statement is proven.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Incorrect Proof
theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1:
  fixes n :: nat 
  shows "(\<Sum> k<n. 2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1"
proof (induction n)
  (* Base case n = 0 *)
  show "(\<Sum> k<0. 2 * k + 3) = (0 + 1)^2 - 1"
    by simp
next
  fix n::nat
  assume IH: "(\<Sum> k<n. 2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1"
  (* Induction step: Show for n + 1 *)
  have "(\<Sum> k<n+1. 2 * k + 3) = (\<Sum> k<n. 2 * k + 3) + 2 * n + 3"
    by simp
  also have "... = (n + 1)^2 - 1 + 2 * n + 3"
    using IH
    by simp
  also have "... = n^2 + 2*n + 1 - 1 + 2*n + 3"
    by (simp add: power2_eq_square)
  also have "... = n^2 + 4*n + 3"
    by simp
  also have "... = (n + 2)^2 - 1"
    by (simp add: power2_eq_square)
  finally show "(\<Sum> k<n+1. 2 * k + 3) = (n + 2)^2 - 1"
    by simp

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Base case n = 0 *)\n  ', 'show "(\\<Sum> k<0. 2 * k + 3) = (0 + 1)^2 - 1"', 'by simp']
In Step 0 of the proof's comments

## Reason
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (\<Sum>k<0::'a. (2::'a) * k + (3::'a)) = (1::'a)\<^sup>2 - (1::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)
Note the type of the expression in the error message suggests you might want to add specific types for step {high_level_step}
