---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"


## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We are dealing with complex numbers here, so we need to ensure that the arithmetic operations on the real and imaginary parts are carried out correctly.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2

Step 1: Given $q = 9 - 4i$ and $e = -3 - 4i$, calculate $q - e$.
Step 2: Perform the subtraction operation, remembering to distribute the negative sign when subtracting $(-3 - 4i)$. 
Step 3: Simplify the expression to get $12$, as $(-4i + 4i)$ cancels out.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"

  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" (* FIXED to include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
    sledgehammer
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. Try to make use of sledgehammer as much as possible. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure needed facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and new comment

In this fixed proof, I have added `by simp` after each relevant step in the proof to ensure that the step is completed successfully. This will allow Isabelle to simplify the expressions and finish the proof without any errors.

    sledgehammer
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. Try to make use of sledgehammer as much as possible. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure needed facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and new comment

## Incorrect Proof
theorem  mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Given q = 9 - 4i and e = -3 - 4i, calculate q - e. *)
  have "q - e = Complex 9 (-4) - Complex (-3) (-4)"
    using h0 h1
    by simp

  (* Step 2: Perform the subtraction operation, remembering to distribute the negative sign when subtracting (-3 - 4i). *)
  then have "q - e = Complex (9 + 3) (-4 + 4)"
    by simp

  (* Step 3: Simplify the expression to get 12, as (-4i + 4i) cancels out. *)
  also have "... = Complex 12 0"
    by simp

  thus ?thesis
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['then', 'have "q - e = Complex (9 + 3) (-4 + 4)"', 'by simp']

## Reason
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. q - e = Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) \<Longrightarrow> Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) = Complex 12 0
At command "by" (line 1)

## Incorrect Proof

Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves basic complex number operations, so the proof is straightforward. We just need to ensure that the addition and subtraction of complex numbers are done correctly.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the complex numbers into the expression $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$.
Step 2: Simplify the expression to get $12$.
