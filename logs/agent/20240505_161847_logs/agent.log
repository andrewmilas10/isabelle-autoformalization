---------------------New Problem (71: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2013_p8.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $x$ and $y$ are distinct nonzero real numbers such that $x+\tfrac{2}{x} = y + \tfrac{2}{y}$, what is $xy$?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 4\qquad $ Show that it is \textbf{(D) }{2}.

## Informal proof
$ x+\tfrac{2}{x}= y+\tfrac{2}{y} $

Since $x\not=y$, we may assume that $x=\frac{2}{y}$ and/or, equivalently, $y=\frac{2}{x}$.

Cross multiply in either equation, giving us $xy=2$.

$\textbf{(D) }{2}$

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2013_p8:
  fixes x y :: real
  assumes h0 : "x\<noteq>0"
    and h1 : "y\<noteq>0"
    and h2 : "x\<noteq>y"
    and h3 : "x + 2/x = y + 2/y"
  shows "x * y = 2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: To show that $xy=2$, we need to carefully consider the key insight that allows us to simplify the problem. Be sure to distinguish the cases when $x = \frac{2}{y}$ and $y = \frac{2}{x}$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Start with the given equation $x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}$.
Step 2: Consider the cases when $x = \frac{2}{y}$ and $y = \frac{2}{x}$ separately.
Step 3: Cross multiply in one of the equations to simplify and find that $xy=2$.
Step 4: Conclude that $xy = 2$, which matches the desired answer.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Find the integer that lies between $\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\sqrt[3]{-101}$. Show that it is -4.

## Informal proof
We have $(-3)^3 = -27$, $(-4)^3 = -64$, and $(-5)^3 = -125$.  Since $-64$ is between $-45$ and $-101$, we know that $\sqrt[3]{-64}$, which equals $-4$, is between $\sqrt[3]{-45}$ and $\sqrt[3]{-101}$.

```

In the fixed proof, I made the following changes:
1. Replaced `by auto` with `by simp` in the Step 1 proof method, ensuring that the simplification is used to solve for the exact values of x, n, and y.
2. Maintained the initial proof method as `by linarith` for Step 2, allowing the comparison of the exact values to directly show n = -4.

These changes should help Isabelle successfully verify the proof without encountering an error at Step 1.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

It seems that the proof provided is incomplete and contains an outer syntax error. To fix the Isabelle proof, I will complete it by adding the necessary statements and eliminate the outer syntax error. 

Here is the corrected Isabelle proof:

## Fixed Proof

  (* Step 0: State the theorem to be proved *)
  (* CHANGE: add the statement of the theorem *)
  "(p → (q ∨ r)) → ((p → q) ∨ (p → r))"

  (* CHANGE: start the proof by assuming the antecedent *)
  assume "p → (q ∨ r)"
  
  (* Step 2: Prove the consequent *)
  (* CHANGE: aim to prove the consequent by considering cases *)
  have "((p → q) ∨ (p → r))"
  proof (rule classical)
    assume "\<not>((p → q) ∨ (p → r))"
    
    have "\<not>(p → q)" and "\<not>(p → r)"
    proof
      assume "p → q"
      from this and \<open>\<not>((p → q) ∨ (p → r))\<close> have "p → r" by auto
      from this and \<open>\<not>(p → q)\<close> show False by blast
    next
      assume "p → r"
      from this and \<open>\<not>((p → q) ∨ (p → r))\<close> have "p → q" by auto
      from this and \<open>\<not>(p → r)\<close> show False by blast
    qed
    from this show "((p → q) ∨ (p → r))" by blast
  qed
  thus "((p → q) ∨ (p → r))" by blast
qed

In this corrected proof, I have added the necessary steps to complete the proof and have removed the outer syntax error. Let me know if you need any more assistance!

---------------------New Problem (73: data/full_data/valid/numbertheory_aneqprodakp4_anmsqrtanp1eq2.json) ------------------------------------
Let $a_0 = 1$. For any positive integer $n$, let $a_{n+1} = \prod_{k = 1}^n a_k + 4$. Show that for any positive integer $n$, $a_n - \sqrt{a_{n+1}} = 2$.

## Informal proof
For $n\geq 1$, we have $a_{n+1} = \prod_{k=1}^n a_k + 4 = (\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k ).a_n + 4 = (a_n - 4).a_n + 4 = a_n^2 - 4.a_n + 4 = (a_n - 2)^2.$
Then $a_n - \sqrt{a_{n+1}} = a_n - \sqrt{(a_n - 2)^2}=2$

## Formal statement
theorem numbertheory_aneqprodakp4_anmsqrtanp1eq2:
  fixes a :: "nat \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes h0 : "a 0 = 1"
    and h1 : "\<And>n. a (n+1) = (\<Prod>(k::nat) =1..n. (a k))+4"
  shows "\<And>n. (n\<ge>1) \<Longrightarrow> a n - sqrt (a (n+1)) = 2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves induction and careful manipulation of the given recursive definition. We need to ensure the induction step is clearly handled and all steps are clearly explained.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: For $n\geq 1$, use the recursive definition of $a_{n+1}$ to show that $a_{n+1} = (a_n - 2)^2$.
Step 2: Then, show that $a_n - \sqrt{a_{n+1}} = a_n - \sqrt{(a_n - 2)^2}$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to conclude that $a_n - \sqrt{a_{n+1}} = 2$. 
Step 4: Use mathematical induction to generalize the result for all positive integers $n$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (74: data/full_data/valid/algebra_sqineq_2at2pclta2c2p41pc.json) ------------------------------------
For real numbers a and c, show that $2a(2+c)\leq a^2+c^2+4(1+c)$.

## Informal proof
$2a(2+c)\leq a^2+c^2+4(1+c) \iff 0\leq (a-c)^2 -4(a-c)+4$
This right hand-side is a second degree polynomial in a-c with discriminant. It follows that it equals 0 in a-c=2 and is positive everywhere else


## Formal statement
theorem algebra_sqineq_2at2pclta2c2p41pc:
  fixes a c :: real
  shows "2 * a * (2+c) \<le> a^2 + c^2 + 4 * (1+c)"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-05 16:52:07,356 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: Breaking down the inequality into simpler components can help when formalizing it in Isabelle. We need to carefully handle the algebraic manipulation and ensure the logic behind the discriminant is clear in the formal proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Rewrite the inequality $2a(2+c) \leq a^2+c^2+4(1+c)$ as $0\leq (a-c)^2 -4(a-c)+4$.
Step 2: Analyze the quadratic expression in terms of $(a-c)$ and consider the discriminant to understand when it is non-negative.
Step 3: Conclude by showing that the expression equals 0 at $(a-c) = 2$ and is positive elsewhere.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We need to carefully manipulate the inequality and show that it simplifies to a polynomial expression in terms of $(a-c)$, which can then be analyzed further by examining its roots and sign.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Start with the given inequality $2a(2+c) \leq a^2 + c^2 + 4(1+c)$.
Step 2: Simplify the inequality to get $0 \leq (a-c)^2 - 4(a-c) + 4$.
Step 3: Recognize that the right-hand side is a quadratic function in $(a-c)$.
Step 4: Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic to find its roots.
Step 5: Analyze the polynomial expression in $(a-c)$, showing that it equals $0$ when $(a-c) = 2$ and is positive for all other values.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

goal (1 subgoal):

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (75: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2013_p7.json) ------------------------------------
The sequence $S_1, S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{10}$ has the property that every term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two.  That is, $ S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-1} \text{ for } n \ge 3. $ Suppose that $S_9 = 110$ and $S_7 = 42$.  What is $S_4$?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16\qquad $ Show that it is \textbf{(C) }{10}.

## Informal proof
$S_9 = 110$, $S_7 = 42$

$S_8 = S_9 - S_ 7 = 110 - 42 = 68$

$S_6 = S_8 - S_7 = 68 - 42 = 26$

$S_5 = S_7 - S_6 = 42 - 26 = 16$

$S_4 = S_6 - S_5 = 26 - 16 = 10$

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C) }{10}$

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (77: data/full_data/valid/amc12_2001_p2.json) ------------------------------------
Let $P(n)$ and $S(n)$ denote the product and the sum, respectively, of the digits
of the integer $n$. For example, $P(23) = 6$ and $S(23) = 5$. Suppose $N$ is a
two-digit number such that $N = P(N)+S(N)$. What is the units digit of $N$?

$\text{(A)}\ 2\qquad \text{(B)}\ 3\qquad \text{(C)}\ 6\qquad \text{(D)}\ 8\qquad \text{(E)}\ 9$ Show that it is (\text{E})9.

## Informal proof
Denote $a$ and $b$ as the tens and units digit of $N$, respectively. Then $N = 10a+b$. It follows that $10a+b=ab+a+b$, which implies that $9a=ab$. Since $a\neq0$, $b=9$. So the units digit of $N$ is $(\text{E})9$.

## Formal statement

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key insight here is realizing that the given two-digit number can be represented as $10a + b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. Then the equation can be written in terms of $a$ and $b$ and simplifying to find the value of the units digit.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Represent the two-digit number as $10a + b$.
Step 2: Set up the equation $10a + b = a \cdot b + a + b$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Given the two functions $f(x)=x^3+2x+1$ and $g(x)=x-1$, find $f(g(1))$. Show that it is 1.

## Informal proof
Since we know that $f(x)=x^3+2x+1$ and $g(x)=x-1$, we can express $f(g(1))$ as $(x-1)^3+2(x-1)+1$. Thus, when $x=1$ we find \begin{align*} (f(g(1))&=(1-1)^3+2(1-1)+1

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Let $u_n$ a sequence defined by $u_0 = 0$ and $\forall n \geq 0, u_{n+1} = 2 u_n + (n + 1)$. Show that $\forall n \geq 0, u(n) = 2^{n+1} - (n+2)$.

## Informal proof
The property is true for $n=0$, since $2^{0+1}-(0+2)=0$.
By induction, assuming the property holds for $n\geq 0$, we have
$u_{n+1}=2u_n+(n+1)=2(2^{n+1}-(n+2))+n+1=2^{n+1+1}-(n+1+2)$, which shows the property at $n+1$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: The proof uses mathematical induction to show the given property for all non-negative integers. Remember to clearly state the base case and the induction step.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Show the base case for $n=0$: $u(0) = 2^{0+1} - (0+2) = 0$.
Step 2: Assume the property holds for some arbitrary $n \geq 0$.
Step 3: Using the assumption and the recursive definition of the sequence, show that $u(n+1) = 2^{n+2} - (n+3)$.
Step 4: By induction, conclude that $\forall n \geq 0, u(n) = 2^{n+1} - (n+2)$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

## Informal proof
We expand to get $2x^2-8x+3x-12+2x^2-12x+3x-18=0$ which is $4x^2-14x-30=0$ after combining like terms. Using the quadratic part of [[Vieta's Formulas]], we find the sum of the roots is $\frac{14}4 = \textbf{(A) }7/2$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: The problem involves polynomial expansion and using Vieta's Formulas to find the sum of the roots. We need to carefully expand the expression and extract the coefficients to determine the sum of the roots.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Expand the given expression $(2x+3)(x-4) + (2x+3)(x-6)$ to get $4x^2 - 14x - 30 = 0$.
Step 2: Using Vieta's Formulas for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a = -(-14)/4 = 7/2$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (83: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_140.json) ------------------------------------
The expression $24x^2-19x-35$ can be written as $(Ax-5)(2Bx+C)$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are positive numbers. Find $AB-3C$. Show that it is -9.

## Informal proof
The expression $24x^2-19x-35$ can be factored as $(3x-5)(8x+7)$. Therefore, $(Ax-5)=(3x-5)$ and $(2Bx+C)=(8x+7)$. From that, $A=3$, $B=4$, and $C=7$. \begin{align*}
AB-3C&=3\cdot4-3\cdot7\\
&=12-21\\
&=-9
\end{align*}

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_140:
  fixes a b c :: real
  assumes h0 : "0 < a \<and> 0 < b \<and> 0 < c"
    and h1 : "\<forall>x. 24 * x^2 - 19 * x - 35 = ((a*x-5) * (2 * (b*x) + c))"

Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, we are given the factorization of the quadratic already, so the work reduces to matching coefficients and solving for the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Given that $24x^2 - 19x - 35 = (Ax-5)(2Bx+C)$, expand the right side to get two equations based on the coefficients.
Step 2: Equate the coefficients of the linear and constant terms on both sides to get the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.
Step 3: Calculate $AB-3C$ using the found values to show that it equals -9.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"

  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (84: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_568.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(a-1)(a+1)(a+2) - (a-2)(a+1).$ Show that it is a^3 + a^2.

## Informal proof
We successively expand by multiplying binomials: \begin{align*}
(a&-1)(a+1)(a+2) - (a-2)(a+1)\\
&= (a^2-1)(a+2)-(a-2)(a+1)\\
&= (a^3 + 2a^2 - a - 2) - (a^2 -a -2)\\
&= a^3 + a^2.
\end{align*}So our answer is just $a^3 + a^2$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (85: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_326.json) ------------------------------------
The product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers? Show that it is 10.

## Informal proof
Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=10$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_326:
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes "(n - 1) * n * (n + 1) = 720" 
  shows "(n + 1) = 10"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The solution involves setting up the consecutive integers as $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$, then simplifying the product and solving for $n$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Express the product of the consecutive integers as $n^3 - n$.
Step 2: Form the equation $n^3 = 720 + n$.
Step 3: Find the cube greater than 720, which is $729 = 9^3$, so $n = 9$.
Step 4: Determine that the largest integer is $n + 1 = 10$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

This update provides additional intermediate steps in Step 1 to clarify the manipulation of the given equation. It breaks down the process of expressing the product of consecutive integers more explicitly before proceeding to form the final equation. It should assist Isabelle in understanding and completing the proof successfully.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We need to carefully set up the consecutive integers based on $n$, then express their product as $n^3$ and set it equal to 720. Finally, we need to derive the largest integer from the solution for $n$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Let the consecutive integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$, then express their product as $n^3$.
Step 2: Set up the equation $n^3 = 720 + n$.
Step 3: Find the smallest perfect cube greater than 720, which is $9^3 = 729$.
Step 4: Confirm that $729 = 720 + 9$, so $n = 9$.
Step 5: Therefore, the largest integer is $n + 1 = 10$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Here is the fixed version of the Isabelle proof:

```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_326:
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes "(n - 1) * n * (n + 1) = 720"
  shows "(n + 1) = 10"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Let the consecutive integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$, then express their product as $n^3$. *)
  have "n^3 - n = 720"
    using assms
  
  (* CHANGE: removed 'sledgehammer' as it was causing an error *)
  
  (* Step 2: Set up the equation $n^3 = 720 + n$. *)
  then have "n^3 = 720 + n"
    by simp

  (* Step 3: Find the smallest perfect cube greater than 720, which is $9^3 = 729$. *)
  have "9^3 = 729"
    by simp

  (* Step 4: Confirm that $729 = 720 + 9$, so $n = 9$. *)
  have "720 + 9 = 729"
    by simp
  hence "n = 9"
    by simp

  (* Step 5: Therefore, the largest integer is $n + 1 = 10$. *)
  then show "(n + 1) = 10"
    by simp
qed
``` 

In this correction, I removed the `sledgehammer` command from Step 1, as it was causing an error. This simplification should address the issue, and the proof should now run without errors.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Incorrect Proof

---------------------New Problem (86: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2021_p7.json) ------------------------------------
What is the least possible value of $(xy-1)^2+(x+y)^2$ for real numbers $x$ and $y$?

$\textbf{(A)} ~0\qquad\textbf{(B)} ~\frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(C)} ~\frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~1 \qquad\textbf{(E)} Show that it is \textbf{(D)} ~1.

## Informal proof
Expanding, we get that the expression is $x^2+2xy+y^2+x^2y^2-2xy+1$ or $x^2+y^2+x^2y^2+1$. By the Trivial Inequality (all squares are nonnegative) the minimum value for this is $\textbf{(D)} ~1$, which can be achieved at $x=y=0$.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2021_p7:
  fixes x y ::real
  shows "1 \<le> ((x * y) - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key idea is to simplify the expression and recognize that it can be represented as a sum of squares. Use properties of squares to find the least possible value.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Expand the expression $(xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2$ to get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2y^2 - 2xy + 1$.
Step 2: Simplify the above to get $x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2 + 1$.
Step 3: Recognize that this expression can be viewed as sum of squares and apply Trivial Inequality to see that the minimum value is $1$.
Step 4: Note that this minimum value is achieved when $x = y = 0$.
Step 5: Using Isabelle tactics, prove that $1 \leq ((x * y) - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2$ by applying simplification and properties of squares.

---------------------New Problem (87: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2015_p10.json) ------------------------------------
Integers $x$ and $y$ with $x>y>0$ satisfy $x+y+xy=80$. What is $x$?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ 8 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 10 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 15 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 18 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 26$ Show that it is \textbf{(E)}\ 26.

## Informal proof
Use [[SFFT]] to get $(x+1)(y+1)=81$. The terms $(x+1)$ and $(y+1)$ must be factors of $81$, which include $1, 3, 9, 27, 81$. Because $x > y$, $x+1$ is equal to $27$ or $81$. But if $x+1=81$, then $y=0$ and so $x=\textbf{(E)}\ 26$.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12a_2015_p10:
  fixes x y:: nat
  assumes h0: "0<y"
    and h1: "y<x"
    and h2: "x+y + (x*y) = 80"

Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT) and then use the information provided to determine the value of x. Given the formal statement already specifies natural numbers, we don't need to worry about non-negativity.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Apply SFFT to the equation $x+y + (x*y) = 80$ to get $(x+1)(y+1)=81$.
Step 2: Determine the factors of 81, keeping in mind that $x>y>0$.
Step 3: Since $x>y$, $x+1$ must be either $27$ or $81$.
Step 4: If $x+1 = 81$, it leads to $y=0$ which is not possible. Therefore, $x = 26$ which is the answer.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: SFFT (Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick) is a useful technique here to factor the expression and simplify the problem. When formalizing, make sure to consider the restrictions of the problem such as $x>y>0$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Apply SFFT to get $(x+1)(y+1) = 81$.
Step 2: List the factors of 81: $1, 3, 9, 27, 81$.
Step 3: Since $x>y>0$ and $x+1$ is larger, $x+1$ must be either $27$ or $81$.
Step 4: If $x+1 = 81$, then $y=0$ which contradicts $x>y>0$, hence $x=26$ being the only option.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then what remainder does $2n+1$ give when divided by 7? Show that it is 0.

## Informal proof
If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $0$.

Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves modular arithmetic properties and integer division. The key step is expressing $n$ in terms of $k$ and then manipulating $2n+1$ to show it is divisible by 7.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Given that $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, express $n$ as $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$.
Step 2: Substitute $n = 7k + 3$ into the expression $2n + 1$ to get $2(7k + 3) + 1 = 14k + 6 + 1 = 14k + 7 = 7(2k + 1)$.
Step 3: Conclude that $2n + 1$ is divisible by 7, so its remainder when divided by 7 is 0.

Let $a$ be an integer, then $a \pmod 3 \in {0, 1, 2}$.
Using that for any natural number $k$, $a \equiv b \pmod 3$ implies $a^k \equiv b^k \pmod 3$, we have $a^2 \pmod 3 \in {0, 1, 4}$. Since $4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ the result follows.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We need to carefully use the properties of modulo arithmetic and the fact that squares preserve congruences in this proof. The key is to understand the possible residues modulo 3 and how squaring affects them.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Introduce the possible residues of $a$ modulo 3 as 0, 1, or 2.
Step 2: Utilize the property that if $a \equiv b \pmod 3$, then $a^k \equiv b^k \pmod 3$ for any natural number $k.
Step 3: Show that $a^2$ modulo 3 can only be 0, 1, or 4.
Step 4: Use the fact that $4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ to conclude that the square of any integer is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (90: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_410.json) ------------------------------------
What is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 - 6x + 13$? Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Write $x^2-6x$ as $(x-3)^2-9$ to obtain  \[
y=(x-3)^2+4.
\]Since $(x-3)^2\geq0$, we have $y\geq4$.  The value $y=4$ is obtained when $x=3$. (Note: this method of rewriting a quadratic expression is called ``completing the square'').

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_410:
  fixes x y :: real
  assumes h0 : "y = x^2 - 6 * x + 13"
  shows "4 \<le> y"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-05 19:18:33,312 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The strategy here involves completing the square to obtain a clear expression for $y$. By understanding the structure, we can easily determine the minimum value of $y$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Rewrite $x^2 - 6x$ as $(x-3)^2 - 9$.
Step 2: Substitute the rewritten expression into $y = (x-3)^2 + 4$.
Step 3: Since $(x-3)^2 \geq 0$, it follows that $y \geq 4$.
Step 4: The minimum value of $y=4$ is achieved when $x=3`.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (91: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_458.json) ------------------------------------
When all the girls at Madeline's school line up in rows of eight, there are seven left over.

If instead they line up in rows of four, how many are left over? Show that it is 3.

## Informal proof
The number of girls is of the form $8n+7$, where $n$ is some integer (the number of rows). This expression can also be written as $4(2n+1)+3$, so when the girls line up in rows of four, they make $2n+1$ rows with $3$ girls left over.

Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves understanding the relationship between the remainders when dividing by 8 and 4, and expressing the number of girls in terms of rows. The key is to show how the number of girls can be expressed as both $8n+7$ and $4(2n+1)+3$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Express the total number of girls as $8n + 7$ where $n$ is an integer representing the number of rows.
Step 2: Rewrite the expression as $4(2n + 1) + 3$ to show that there are 3 girls left over when lining up in rows of four.

Solve for $a$: $\frac15|9+2a|<1$.  Express your answer in interval notation. Show that it is (-7, -2).

## Informal proof
Multiplying by 5 gives $|9+2a|<5$, so we must have  $$-5 < 9+2a < 5.$$Subtracting 9 from all three parts of this inequality chain gives  $$-14 < 2a < -4,$$and dividing by 2 gives $-7 < a < -2,$ or $a \in (-7, -2)$ in interval notation.

## Formal statement

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key steps involve manipulating the absolute value inequality to isolate $a$ in the given interval notation.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Multiply both sides of the inequality $\frac{1}{5}|9+2a|<1$ by $5$ to get $|9+2a|<5$.
Step 2: Rewrite $|9+2a|<5$ as two separate inequalities: $9+2a<5$ and $9+2a>-5$.
Step 3: Solve the inequalities $9+2a<5$ and $9+2a > -5$ separately to get $-14<2a<-4$.
Step 4: Divide by $2$ to obtain $-7 < a < -2$.
Step 5: Express the solution as $a \in (-7, -2)$ in interval notation.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

For any integer $a$, show that $a^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$ or $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

## Informal proof
$a \pmod 4 \in {0, 1, 2, 3}$.
Using that for any natural number $k$, $a \equiv b \pmod 4$ implies $a^k \equiv b^k \pmod 4$, we have  $a^2 \pmod 4 \in {0, 1, 4, 9}$. Since $4 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$ and $9 \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, the result follows.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

Notes for Structured proof: We need to utilize the properties of modular arithmetic and the behavior of squares modulo 4 to derive the possible residues for $a^2 \pmod{4}$. Make sure to explicitly state the possible residues.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: As $a \pmod 4 \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, we know that $a^2 \pmod 4$ can be in $\{0, 1, 4, 9\}$.
Step 2: Apply the property that if $a \equiv b \pmod 4$, then $a^k \equiv b^k \pmod 4$ to infer that $a^2 \pmod 4$ is in $\{0, 1, 0, 1\}$.
Step 3: Since $4 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$ and $9 \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, conclude that $a^2 \pmod 4$ must be either $0$ or $1$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (94: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_77.json) ------------------------------------
Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation  $${x^2 + ax + b = 0}$$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then what is the pair $(a,b)$? Show that it is (1,-2).

## Informal proof
The given conditions imply that $$
x^2 + ax + b = (x-a)(x-b) = x^2 -(a+b)x + ab,
$$ so $$
a+b = -a \quad\text{and}\quad ab = b.
$$ Since $b \neq 0$, the second equation implies that $a=1$. The first equation gives $b=-2$, so $(a,b) = (1,-2)$.

  fixes a b :: real

Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, we need to carefully manipulate the given polynomial and the conditions to determine the values of $a$ and $b$. This involves factorization, setting coefficients equal to each other, and solving the resulting system of equations.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Utilize the relationships between the solutions $a$ and $b$ and the coefficients $a$ and $b$ of the polynomial to set up the equations $a + b = -a$ and $ab = b$.
Step 2: From $ab = b$ and given $b \neq 0$, conclude that $a = 1$.
Step 3: Substitute $a = 1$ into $a + b = -a$ to find $b = -2$.
Step 4: Therefore, the pair $(a,b) = (1,-2)$.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key to this problem is correctly expressing the given polynomial in terms of its roots and then using those expressions to solve for $a$ and $b$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Express the polynomial $x^2 + ax + b$ in terms of its roots as $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 -(a+b)x + ab$.
Step 2: Equate the coefficients of the polynomial to find that $a+b = -a$ and $ab = b$.
Step 3: From $ab = b$ and $b \neq 0$, conclude that $a = 1$.

If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (95: data/full_data/valid/amc12b_2002_p6.json) ------------------------------------
Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the [[equation]] $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then the pair $(a,b)$ is

$\mathrm{(A)}\ (-2,1)
\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ (-1,2)
\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ (1,-2)
\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ (2,-1)
\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ (4,4)$ Show that it is \mathrm{(C)}\ (1,-2).

## Informal proof
Since $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = x^2 + ax + b = 0$, it follows by comparing [[coefficient]]s that $-a - b = a$ and that $ab = b$. Since $b$ is nonzero, $a = 1$, and $-1 - b = 1 \Longrightarrow b = -2$. Thus $(a,b) = \mathrm{(C)}\ (1,-2)$.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12b_2002_p6:
  fixes a b :: real
  assumes "a \<noteq> 0 \<and> b \<noteq> 0"
      and "\<forall> x. x^2 + a * x + b = (x - a) * (x - b)"

Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves careful manipulation of the given equation and comparing coefficients to determine the values of $a$ and $b$. Make sure to emphasize the steps where coefficients are compared and set equal to each other.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: From the expanded form of $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab$ and the given equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$, compare coefficients to get $-a - b = a$ and $ab = b$.
Step 2: Solve the system of equations derived from the comparisons. We get $a = 1$ and $b = -2$.
Step 3: Thus, the pair $(a,b)$ is indeed $(1,-2)$, matching choice $\mathrm{(C)}$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: The key to this problem is to carefully compare coefficients in the polynomial expansion of $(x-a)(x-b)$ with the given quadratic equation. This comparison allows us to determine the values of $a$ and $b$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Expand $(x-a)(x-b)$ to get $x^2 - (a+b)x + ab$ and set it equal to the given quadratic $x^2 + ax + b = 0$.
Step 2: By comparing coefficients, we get the equations $-a - b = a$ and $ab = b$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (96: data/full_data/valid/amc12a_2008_p4.json) ------------------------------------
Which of the following is equal to the [[product]]
$\frac{8}{4}\cdot\frac{12}{8}\cdot\frac{16}{12}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{4n+4}{4n}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{2008}{2004}?$

## Informal proof
$\frac {8}{4}\cdot\frac {12}{8}\cdot\frac {16}{12}\cdots\frac {4n + 4}{4n}\cdots\frac {2008}{2004} = \frac {1}{4}\cdot\left(\frac {8}{8}\cdot\frac {12}{12}\cdots\frac {4n}{4n}\cdots\frac {2004}{2004}\right)\cdot 2008 = \frac{2008}{4} =$ $502 \Rightarrow B$.

Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Incorrect Proof
theorem amc12a_2008_p4:
  "(\<Prod>k::nat=1..501. ((4::real) * k + 4) / (4 * k)) = 502"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Rewrite the given product as $\frac{1}{4}\cdot \left( \frac{8}{8}\cdot\frac{12}{12}\cdots\frac{4n}{4n}\cdots\frac{2004}{2004} \right)\cdot 2008$. *)
  have "(\<Prod>k::nat=1..501. ((4::real) * k + 4) / (4 * k)) = (1/4) * (\<Prod>k::nat=1..501. ((4::real) * k) / (4 * k)) * 2008"
    by simp
  (* Step 2: Simplify the inner bracketed expression to get $\frac{2008}{4}$. *)
  also have "... = (1/4) * 2008"
    by (subst prod_dividef)
  also have "... = 502"
    by simp
  (* Step 3: Calculate the final result as $\frac{2008}{4} = 502$, hence the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$. *)
  finally show ?thesis
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['also', 'have "... = (1/4) * 2008"', 'by (subst prod_dividef)']
In Step 2 of the proof's comments

## Reason
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. 1 / 4 * ((\<Prod>x = 1..501. 4 * real x) / (\<Prod>x = 1..501. 4 * real x)) * 2008 = 1 / 4 * 2008

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

    by simp
