---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"


## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key idea here is to simplify the expression step by step by combining real parts and imaginary parts separately.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the complex numbers into the expression, so we get $q - e = (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i)$.
Step 2: Simplify to $9 - 4i + 3 + 4i$.
Step 3: Combine the real parts to get $9 + 3$.
Step 4: Combine the imaginary parts to get $0$, so the result is $12$.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Substitute the complex numbers into the expression, so we get $q - e = (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i)$. *)
  have "q - e = complex_of_real 9 - complex_of_real (-4) - (complex_of_real (-3) - complex_of_real (-4))"
    using h0 h1
    by simp
  also have "... = complex_of_real 9 + complex_of_real 4 - complex_of_real (-3) + complex_of_real 4"
    by simp
  also have "... = Complex 9 0 + Complex 3 0"
    by simp
  (* Step 2: Simplify to $9 - 4i + 3 + 4i$. *)
  also have "... = Complex 12 0"
    by simp
  (* Step 3: Combine the real parts to get $9 + 3$. *)
  finally have "q - e = Complex 12 0"
    by simp

However, you encountered an error at step 1 where, specifically, you wrote by simp due to the following reason:
Step error: Failed to finish proof (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. \<lbrakk>q = Complex 9 (- 4); e = Complex (- 3) (- 4)\<rbrakk> \<Longrightarrow> Complex 9 (- 4) - Complex (- 3) (- 4) = 12
At command "by" (line 1)
Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities, and that you are using sledgehammer as opposed to other proof methods (i.e. please don't ever use simple in your proofs). If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to prove the entire full proof again with your changes
