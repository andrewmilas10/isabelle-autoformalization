---------------------New Problem (13: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_427.json) ------------------------------------
Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Sum all three equations to find that $6x+6y+6z=17+14+41$, from which $x+y+z=72/6=12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_427:
  fixes x y z :: real
  assumes "3 * x + y = 17"
    and "5 * y + z = 14"
    and "3 * x + 5 * z = 41" 
  shows "x + y + z = 12"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to simplify the system of equations by adding them together to eliminate variables and solve directly for the sum $x+y+z$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Add all three equations $3x+y=17$, $5y+z=14$, and $3x+5z=41$ to get $6x+6y+6z=72$.
Step 2: Simplify to find $x+y+z=72/6=12$.
