---------------------New Problem (152: data/full_data/valid/amc12b_2003_p6.json) ------------------------------------
The second and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are $2$ and $6$. Which of the following is a possible first term?

$\textbf{(A) } -\sqrt{3}  \qquad\textbf{(B) } -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \qquad\textbf{(C) } -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \sqrt{3} \qquad\textbf{(E) } 3$ Show that it is \textbf{(B)}\ -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}.

## Informal proof
Let the first term be $ a $ and the common ratio be $ r $. Therefore, 

$ar=2\ \ (1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad ar^3=6\ \ (2)$

Dividing $(2)$ by $(1)$ eliminates the $ a $, yielding $ r^2=3 $, so $ r=\pm\sqrt{3} $.

Now, since $ ar=2 $, $ a=\frac{2}{r} $, so $ a=\frac{2}{\pm\sqrt{3}}=\pm\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} $.

We therefore see that $ \textbf{(B)}\ -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a possible first term.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12b_2003_p6:
  fixes a r::real and u::"nat \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes "\<forall> k. u k = a * r^k"
    and "u 1= 2"
    and "u 3=6"
  shows "u 0 = 2/ sqrt 3  \<or> u 0 = - 2/sqrt 3"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The solution involves setting up the geometric sequence and solving for the possible first term given the second and fourth terms. This entails carefully manipulating the equations to find the first term.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Let the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$, leading to $ar = 2$ and $ar^3 = 6$.
Step 2: Divide the second equation by the first to find $r^2 = 3$, resulting in $r = \pm \sqrt{3}$.
Step 3: Use $ar = 2$ to express $a = \frac{2}{r}$ and hence $a = \frac{2}{\pm \sqrt{3}} = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
Step 4: Thus, the possible first terms are $a = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ or $a = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$, showing that $\textbf{(B)}\ -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$ is a valid first term.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (153: data/full_data/valid/induction_sum_1oktkp1.json) ------------------------------------
Show that for positive integer $n$, $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{n}{n+1}$.

## Informal proof
We show the result by induction. The result is trivial for $n=1$. Let us assume the result holds for $n \geq 1$. Then, we have $\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{n}{n+1} + \frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{n(n+2)+1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{n^2+2n+1}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{(n+1)^2}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{n+1}{n+2}$. So the result holds for $n+1$, and by induction it is true for every positive integer $n$.

## Formal statement
theorem induction_sum_1oktkp1:

Notes for Structured proof: The key strategy here is to clearly lay out the base case and then the induction step, making sure to clearly show the induction hypothesis and how it leads to the desired result for $n+1$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: Base case: Show that the statement holds for $n=1$, which is trivial.
Step 2: Induction step: Assume the statement holds for some $n ≥ 1$.
Step 3: Inductive hypothesis: Express the sum up to $n$ using the assumption.
Step 4: Add the next term $\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)}$ to the sum.
Step 5: Simplify the sum and show that it equals $\frac{n+1}{n+2}$.
Step 6: Conclude that the statement holds for $n+1$, completing the induction step.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (154: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_73.json) ------------------------------------
Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be constants. One solution to the equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ is $x=r$. Find the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$. Show that it is p+q-r.

## Informal proof
If we expand the left side, we have  \begin{align*}
(x-p)(x-q) &=x(x-q) -p(x-q)\\
& = x^2 - qx - px +pq \\
&= x^2 -(p+q)x + pq.
\end{align*} The other side of the equation is a constant, since there isn't an $x$ term. So, if we view the equation as a quadratic in $x$, the sum of the roots is $-[-(p+q)] = p+q$.  We know that one of the roots is $r$, so if the other is $s$, we have $r+s = p+q$, so $s = p+q-r$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_73:
  fixes p q r x :: complex
  assumes h0 : "(x-p) * (x-q) = (r-p) * (r-q)"
    and h1 : "x \<noteq> r"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, we are essentially expanding and equating coefficients of a quadratic equation. It is important to clearly identify the coefficients and the constant term in both sides of the equation before concluding the proof.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Expand the left side of the equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ to get $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq$.
Step 2: Note that the right side is a constant, so there is no $x$ term.
Step 3: Recognize that the sum of the roots of the quadratic is obtained by negating the coefficient of $x$, giving us $-(p+q) = p+q$. 
Step 4: Since one of the roots is known to be $r$, let the other root be denoted as $s$. The sum of the roots $r+s$ is equal to $p+q$, leading to $s = p+q-r$.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: When translating to Isabelle, we need to carefully define the operations on complex numbers and ensure the assumptions are clearly incorporated into the proof steps. The main strategy involves expanding the left side and recognizing it as a quadratic equation in $x$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Expand $(x-p)(x-q)$ to get $x^2 -(p+q)x + pq$.
Step 2: Recognize that the other side of the equation is a constant, leading to the conclusion that the sum of roots of the quadratic is $p+q$.
Step 3: Since one root is known to be $r$, deduce that the other root is $s = p+q-r$, hence proving the desired result.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do.

---------------------New Problem (155: data/full_data/valid/mathd_numbertheory_221.json) ------------------------------------
How many natural numbers less than 1000 have exactly three distinct positive integer divisors? Show that it is 11.

## Informal proof
By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive divisors. Thus we must count the number of primes between 1 and $\sqrt{1000}$ (the squares of these primes are all the natural numbers less than 1000 that have exactly three positive divisors). There are $11$ such primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_221:
  "card {x ::nat. 0 < x \<and> x < 1000 \<and> card ({n. n dvd x}) = 3} = 11"

## Structured informal proof


2024-05-08 06:24:16,791 - agent - INFO - 
----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We need to carefully identify the numbers that have exactly three positive divisors using the formula for the total number of positive divisors. We then need to determine the primes whose squares are less than 1000 to find the count of such numbers.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Recall that only numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive divisors.
Step 2: List out the primes less than or equal to $\sqrt{1000}$ to find the numbers with exactly three positive divisors.
Step 3: Count the primes obtained in Step 2 to determine that there are 11 such numbers with exactly three positive divisors.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

---------------------New Problem (156: data/full_data/valid/algebra_xmysqpymzsqpzmxsqeqxyz_xpypzp6dvdx3y3z3.json) ------------------------------------
Let x, y, and z be integers. If $(x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2 = xyz$, then $(x+y+z+6)$ divides $(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$.

## Informal proof
We have $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-xz-yz) = \frac{1}{2}(x+y+z)\left((x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2\right)$.
Using the hypothesis,  $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = \frac{xyz}{2}(x+y+z)$. Thus, $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = \frac{(x+y+z+6)(xyz)}{2}$.
Finally, since $xyz = (x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2 = 2(x^2+y^2+z^2-xy-xz-yz)$: so $xyz=2k$ for some integer $k$ and we have $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k(x+y+z+6)$, which completes the proof.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This proof involves algebraic manipulation to simplify expressions and relate them to the given condition. It requires careful handling of terms and factorization.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 8
Step 1: Start by expanding and simplifying the expression $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$ using known identities.
Step 2: Use the hypothesis to rewrite the expression in terms of $(x+y+z)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression further to obtain $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = \frac{(x+y+z+6)(xyz)}{2}$.
Step 4: Utilize the fact that $xyz = (x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)$ to show $xyz = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
Step 5: Conclude that $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k(x+y+z+6)$, which implies that $(x+y+z+6)$ divides $(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

Notes for Structured proof: To formalize this proof, we need to carefully manipulate the given equations and expressions to reach the conclusion. We will make use of basic algebraic identities and properties.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Start from $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = \frac{1}{2}(x+y+z)((x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2)$.
Step 2: Since we are given that $(x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2 = xyz$, substitute this into the above equation to get $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = \frac{1}{2}xyz(x+y+z)$.
Step 3: Simplify the expression to obtain $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = \frac{(x+y+z+6)(xyz)}{2}$.
Step 4: From the given equation $(x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2 = xyz$, deduce that $xyz = 2k$ for some integer $k$.
Step 5: Substitute $xyz = 2k$ into the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = \frac{(x+y+z+6)(xyz)}{2}$ to get $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k(x+y+z+6)$.
Step 6: Conclude that $(x+y+z+6)$ divides $(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$ based on the last derived equation.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

What is the remainder when $1999^{2000}$ is divided by $5?$ Show that it is 1.

## Informal proof
Since any positive integer(expressed in base ten) is some multiple of $5$ plus its last digit, its remainder when divided by $5$ can be obtained by knowing its last digit.

Note that $1999^1$ ends in $9,$ $1999^2$ ends in $1,$ $1999^3$ ends in $9,$ $1999^4$ ends in $1,$ and this alternation of $9$ and $1$ endings continues with all even powers ending in $1.$ Therefore, the remainder when $1999^{2000}$ is divided by $5$ is $1.$

## Formal statement

  "(1999^2000) mod 5 = (1::nat)"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The informal method relies on identifying the cyclical pattern of the last digit when powers of 1999 are taken. In formalizing, we need to focus on the cyclical nature and the fact that odd and even powers lead to different remainders.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Consider the units digit of powers of 1999: $1999^1 \equiv 9, 1999^2 \equiv 1, 1999^3 \equiv 9, 1999^4 \equiv 1$, and so on.
Step 2: Notice the alternating pattern where even powers end in 1 and odd powers end in 9.
Step 3: Realize that $1999^{2000}$ is an even power and therefore ends in 1.
Step 4: Conclude that the remainder when $1999^{2000}$ is divided by 5 is 1.

Solve the system of equations

$|a_1 - a_2| x_2 +|a_1 - a_3| x_3 +|a_1 - a_4| x_4 = 1\\ |a_2 - a_1| x_1 +|a_2 - a_3| x_3 +|a_2 - a_4| x_4 = 1\\ |a_3 - a_1| x_1 +|a_3 - a_2| x_2 +|a_3-a_4|x_4= 1\\ |a_4 - a_1| x_1 +|a_4 - a_2| x_2 +|a_4 - a_3| x_3 = 1$

where $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ are four different real numbers.

## Informal proof
Take a1 > a2 > a3 > a4. Subtracting the equation for i=2 from that for i=1 and dividing by (a1 - a2) we get:

$- x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0.$

Subtracting the equation for i=4 from that for i=3 and dividing by (a3 - a4) we get:

$- x1 - x2 - x3 + x4 = 0.$

Hence x1 = x4. Subtracting the equation for i=3 from that for i=2 and dividing by (a2 - a3) we get:

$- x1 - x2 + x3 + x4 = 0.$

Hence $x2 = x3 = 0$, and $x1 = x4 = 1/(a1 - a4)$.
