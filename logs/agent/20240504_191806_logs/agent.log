---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement
theorem algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2:
  fixes a b c :: complex
  assumes h0 : "a+b = 2*c"
    and h1 : "c = \<i>"
  shows "a*c+b*c=-2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: Since $c = \text{Im}(1) = i$, we can perform algebraic manipulations to simplify the expression $ac + bc$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Given $c = i$, substitute $c$ into the expression $a+b = 2c$ to get $a + b = 2i$.
Step 2: Multiply the equation $a+b = 2i$ by $i$ to obtain $ai + bi = 2i^2$.
Step 3: Simplify $2i^2$ to get $-2$, which gives $a*c + b*c = -2$.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:

  (* Step 3: Simplify $2i^2$ to get $-2$, which gives $a*c + b*c = -2$ *)

However, you encountered an error at step 3 where, specifically, you wrote qed due to the following reason:

Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instant that Isabelle is ableto deduce the types of all quantities, and that you are using sledgehammer as opposed to other proof methods. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle:
