---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/test/imo_1963_p5.json) ------------------------------------
Prove that $\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}-\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}=\frac{1}{2}$.

## Informal proof
Let $\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}-\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}=S$. We have

$S=\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}-\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}=\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}+\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}+\cos{\frac{5\pi}{7}}$

Then, by product-sum formulae, we have

$S * 2* \sin{\frac{\pi}{7}} = \sin{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\sin{\frac{4\pi}{7}}-\sin{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\sin{\frac{6\pi}{7}}-\sin{\frac{4\pi}{7}}=\sin{\frac{6\pi}{7}}=\sin{\frac{\pi}{7}}$

Thus $S = 1/2$. $\blacksquare$

## Formal statement
theorem imo_1963_p5 :
  "cos (pi / 7) - cos (2 * pi / 7) + cos (3 * pi / 7) = 1 / 2"

---------------------New Problem (2: data/full_data/test/mathd_numbertheory_296.json) ------------------------------------
What is the smallest positive integer, other than $1$, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power? Show that it is 4096.

## Informal proof
If $n$ is a perfect cube, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $3$. If $n$ is a perfect fourth power, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $4$. The only way both of these statements can be true is for all the exponents to be divisible by $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[3,4]=12$, so such an $n$ must be a perfect twelfth power. Since we aren't using $1^{12}=1,$ the next smallest is $2^{12}=4096.$

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_296:
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes "2 \<le> n"
    and "\<exists> x. x^3 = n"
    and "\<exists> t. t^4 = n"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The key here is to understand the relationship between perfect cubes, perfect fourth powers, and perfect twelfth powers in terms of their prime factorization exponents. We need to show why the number must be a perfect twelfth power given the constraints provided.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Since $n$ is a perfect cube, all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by 3.
Step 2: Since $n$ is a perfect fourth power, all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by 4.
Step 3: The number $n$ must have exponents divisible by $\text{lcm}(3,4) = 12$ to satisfy both properties.
Step 4: Hence, $n$ must be a perfect twelfth power.
Step 5: The smallest positive integer that is a perfect twelfth power (other than $1$) is $2^{12} = 4096$.
Step 6: Therefore, $4096 \leq n$.

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 2)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, the key insight is recognizing that a number that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power must also be a perfect twelfth power. The difficulty lies in translating this insight into the required form for Isabelle.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 6
Step 1: Note that for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, its prime factorization exponents must be divisible by $3$ and $4$ respectively.
Step 2: Since $n$ is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, the exponents in its prime factorization must be divisible by $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[3, 4] = 12$.
Step 3: Deduce that $n$ must be a perfect twelfth power, meaning all the exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $12$.
Step 4: Since it can't be $1^{12}$, the smallest number meeting this criterion is $2^{12} = 4096$. Therefore, $4096 \leq n$.

Step 1: Since $n$ is a perfect cube, the exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by 3.
Step 2: Similarly, since $n$ is a perfect fourth power, the exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by 4.

---------------------New Problem (3: data/full_data/test/mathd_numbertheory_447.json) ------------------------------------
What is the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$? Show that it is 78.

## Informal proof
We start by computing the sum of the units digits of all multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$. Excluding $0$, every possible digit appears exactly once as a unit digit of a multiple of $3$: the set of multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$ consists of the numbers $0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30$. Thus, the sum of their units digits is equal to $$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 45.$$ We must sum the units digits of the multiples of $3$ between $31$ and $50$. The relevant multiples of $3$ are  $33,36,39,42,45,48$, and the sum of their units digits is $3+6+9+2+5+8 = 33$. Thus, the answer is $45 + 33 = 78$.

---------------------New Problem (4: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_293.json) ------------------------------------
Calculate $\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.

Note: When entering a square root with more than one character, you must use parentheses or brackets.  For example, you should enter $\sqrt{14}$ as "sqrt(14)" or "sqrt{14}". Show that it is 36x \sqrt{35x}.

## Informal proof
Writing everything in terms of prime factorizations, the given expression is  \begin{align*}
&\sqrt{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 3^2 \cdot x^3} \\
& \qquad = \sqrt{(3^4 \cdot 2^4 \cdot x^2) \cdot (5 \cdot 7 \cdot x)} \\
& \qquad = 36x \sqrt{35x}.
\end{align*}

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_293:
  fixes x :: real 
  shows "sqrt (60 * x) * sqrt (12 * x) * sqrt (63 * x) 
                = 36 * x * sqrt (35 * x)"

---------------------New Problem (5: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_289.json) ------------------------------------
The two positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ are $k$ and $t$, where $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers and $k > t$. What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$? Show that it is 20.

## Informal proof
From $x^2-mx+n=0$, we get $k+t=m$ and $kt=n$. Since $n$ is prime, one of $k$ and $t$ is $n$ and the other is 1. $k>t$, so $k=n$ and $t=1$. Then $m=n+1$. $m$ is also prime, so we have two consecutive integers that are prime. Since one of every two consecutive integers is even, and the only even prime is 2, we must have $n=2$ and $m=3$. Therefore, $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k= 3^2+2^3+2^1+1^2=9+8+2+1=20$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_289:
  fixes k t m n :: nat
  assumes "prime m \<and> prime n"
    and "t < k"
    and "k^2 + n - m * k  = 0"
    and "t^2 + n - m * t  = 0" 
  shows "m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = 20"

---------------------New Problem (6: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_160.json) ------------------------------------
For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job? Show that it is \$ 139.

## Informal proof
We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \begin{align*}
N+x &= 97\\
N+5x &= 265
\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \begin{align*}
4x &= 265-97=168\\
x &= 42.
\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \$ 55+2\cdot \$ 42 = \$ 139$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_160:
  fixes n x ::real
  assumes "n + x = 97"
      and "n + 5 * x = 265"
    shows "n + 2 * x = 139"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves solving a system of linear equations, so we need to carefully solve for the values of $N$ and $x$ before calculating the charge for a two-hour repair job.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Write the system of equations given in the problem: $N+x = 97$ and $N+5x = 265$.
Step 2: Subtract the first equation from the second to get $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$.
Step 3: Solve for $x$, finding $x = 42$.
Step 4: Substitute $x = 42$ back into the first equation to solve for $N$: $N = 97 - 42 = 55$.
Step 5: Calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job: $N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 139$.

---------------------New Problem (7: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_362.json) ------------------------------------
If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, $a^2b^3=\frac{32}{27}$, and $\frac{a}{b^3}=\frac{27}{4}$, what is $a+b$? Show that it is \frac83.

## Informal proof
Rearranging the second equation, we have that $b^3=\frac{4}{27}a$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\frac{4}{27}a^3=\frac{32}{27}$; after multiplying each side by $\frac{27}{4}$ and taking the cube root, we see that $a=2$. Substituting $a$ into the first equation, we get that $b^3=\frac{8}{27}$ or $b=\frac23$. Thus, $a+b=2+\frac23=\frac83$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_362:
  fixes a b :: real

---------------------New Problem (8: data/full_data/test/amc12b_2020_p2.json) ------------------------------------
What is the value of the following expression?

$\frac{100^2-7^2}{70^2-11^2} \cdot \frac{(70-11)(70+11)}{(100-7)(100+7)}$

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{9951}{9950} \qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{4780}{4779} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{108}{107} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{81}{80} $ Show that it is \textbf{(A) } 1.

## Informal proof
Using difference of squares to factor the left term, we get
$\frac{100^2-7^2}{70^2-11^2} \cdot \frac{(70-11)(70+11)}{(100-7)(100+7)} = \frac{(100-7)(100+7)}{(70-11)(70+11)} \cdot \frac{(70-11)(70+11)}{(100-7)(100+7)}.$
Cancelling all the terms, we get $\textbf{(A) } 1$ as the answer.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12b_2020_p2 :
  shows "((100 ^ 2 - 7 ^ 2)) / (70 ^ 2 - 11 ^ 2) * 
    ((70 - 11) * (70 + 11) / ((100 - 7) * (100 + 7))) = (1::real)"
