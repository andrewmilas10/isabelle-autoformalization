---------------------New Problem (151: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_119.json) ------------------------------------
Solve for $e$, given that $2d$ is $8$ less than $17e$, and $2e$ is $9$ less than $d$. Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
We begin with a system of two equations \begin{align*}
2d&=17e-8
\\2e&=d-9
\end{align*}Since the second equation can also be rewritten as $d=2e+9$, we can plug this expression for $d$ back into the first equation and solve for $e$ \begin{align*}
2d&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 2(2e+9)&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 4e+18&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad -13e&=-26
\\\Rightarrow \qquad e&=2.
\end{align*}

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_119:
  fixes d e :: real
  assumes h0 : "2 * d = 17 * e - 8"
    and h1 : "2 * e = d - 9"
  shows "e = 2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: We are given a system of two equations and need to carefully substitute to solve for $e$. It's important to simplify the expressions and perform the substitutions correctly to isolate $e$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 4
Step 1: Write down the two equations $2d = 17e - 8$ and $2e = d - 9$.
Step 2: Rearrange the second equation to get $d = 2e + 9$.
Step 3: Substitute the expression for $d$ in terms of $e$ into the first equation, resulting in $2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8$.
Step 4: Solve the resulting equation to find $e = 2$.

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.

## Informal proof
Let the first term be $ a $ and the common ratio be $ r $. Therefore, 

$ar=2\ \ (1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad ar^3=6\ \ (2)$

Dividing $(2)$ by $(1)$ eliminates the $ a $, yielding $ r^2=3 $, so $ r=\pm\sqrt{3} $.

Now, since $ ar=2 $, $ a=\frac{2}{r} $, so $ a=\frac{2}{\pm\sqrt{3}}=\pm\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} $.

We therefore see that $ \textbf{(B)}\ -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a possible first term.

## Formal statement
theorem amc12b_2003_p6:
  fixes a r::real and u::"nat \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes "\<forall> k. u k = a * r^k"
    and "u 1= 2"
    and "u 3=6"
  shows "u 0 = 2/ sqrt 3  \<or> u 0 = - 2/sqrt 3"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: The problem involves finding the first term of a geometric sequence given the second and fourth terms. Substituting the values into the general formula for a geometric sequence helps get the possible first term.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Let the first term be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$. Write the equations $ar=2$ and $ar^3=6$.
Step 2: Divide the second equation by the first to solve for $r$ and get $r^2=3$, leading to $r=\pm \sqrt{3}$.
Step 3: Since $a=\frac{2}{r}$, substitute $r=\pm \sqrt{3}$ to find $a=\pm \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
Step 4: Confirm that the possible first term matches the choice \textbf{(B)} $-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$ to conclude the proof.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. If you believe your statement is correct, but Isabelle is having trouble applying proof methods to prove it, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure neccessary facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for the step with the specified error.
