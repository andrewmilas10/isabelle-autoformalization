---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement

Notes for Structured proof: This problem involves basic algebraic manipulations with complex numbers. While it seems simple, we need to ensure the complex number operations are correctly represented in Isabelle.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the given values of $a + b$ and $c$ into the expression $ac + bc$.
Step 2: Simplify the expression to get $(a + b)c = 2c^2$.
Step 3: Using the fact that $c = i$, further simplify to $2i^2 = -2$ to conclude the proof.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:
theorem mathd_algebra_15:

  assumes h0: "\<And>a b. s a b = a ^ b + b ^ a"
  shows "s 2 6 = 100"

However, you encountered an error at step 1 where, specifically, you wrote normalhammer due to the following reason:
Step error: Outer syntax error (line 1): command expected,
but identifier Timeout (line 1) was found
At command "<malformed>" (line 1)
Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities, and that you are using sledgehammer as opposed to other proof methods. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle:
