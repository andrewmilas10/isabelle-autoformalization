---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement
theorem algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2:
  fixes a b c :: complex
  assumes h0 : "a+b = 2*c"
    and h1 : "c = \<i>"
  shows "a*c+b*c=-2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Given $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, we can substitute $c = \text{Im}(1) = \text{Im}(1+0\cdot\text{i}) = \text{Im}(1) = 0$ into the equation $a+b = 2c$ to get $a+b = 2\cdot 0$.
Step 2: Simplify $a+b = 0$.
Step 3: Now, we can find $ac + bc$ as $(a+b)c = 0\cdot 0 = 0 = -2$.
