---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/test/mathd_algebra_484.json) ------------------------------------
Evaluate $\log_327$. Show that it is 3.

## Informal proof
Since $3^3=27$, $\log_327=3$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_484 :
  "(ln 27) / (ln 3) = (3::real)"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This is a straightforward problem involving properties of logarithms and exponentiation. We need to ensure the types are specified as real numbers in Isabelle.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 1
Step 1: Use the property of logarithms to rewrite $\log_3 27$ as $\frac{\ln 27}{\ln 3}$.
Step 2: Substitute $27 = 3^3$ to get $\frac{\ln 3^3}{\ln 3}$.
Step 3: Simplify to $\frac{3\ln 3}{\ln 3}$ and finally simplify to $3$ using the rule of logarithms.
