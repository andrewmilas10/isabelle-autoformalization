---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement

Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute the value of $c$ into the expression $ac + bc$ to get $(a+b)c$.
Step 2: Since $a+b = 2c$, we have $(a+b)c = 2c^2$.
Step 3: As $c = \text{Im}(1) = i$, we get $2c^2 = 2i^2 = -2$.
Step 4: Therefore, $ac + bc = -2$.

Simplify $(2-2i)(5+5i)$, where $i^2 = -1.$ Show that it is 20.

## Informal proof
$(2-2i)(5+5i) = 2(5) + 2(5i) -2i(5) -2i(5i) = 10+10i-10i +10 = 20$.

## Formal statement

## Informal proof
Calculate $\sqrt{196}=\sqrt{2^2\cdot7^2}=2\cdot7$. The sum of the four positive factors is $1+2+7+14=24$.
