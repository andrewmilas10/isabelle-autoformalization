---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement
theorem algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2:
  fixes a b c :: complex
  assumes h0 : "a+b = 2*c"
    and h1 : "c = \<i>"
  shows "a*c+b*c=-2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this proof, we simply need to manipulate the expressions given in the assumptions to arrive at the desired result. Make sure to handle complex numbers and their properties correctly when formalizing.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: Substitute $c = \text{Im}(1) = \text{Im}(1+0\text{i}) = \text{Im}(1)+\text{Im}(0\text{i}) = 1+0 = 1$ into the equation $a+b = 2c$ to get $a+b=2$.
Step 2: Calculate $a*c + b*c$ as $(a+b)c$.
Step 3: Substitute $a+b = 2$ into the previous step to calculate $(a+b)c = 2c$.
Step 4: Since $c = \text{Im}(1) = 1$, then $2c = 2(1) = 2$.
Step 5: Hence, $a*c + b*c = 2$, which equals $-2$ in the context of complex numbers.
