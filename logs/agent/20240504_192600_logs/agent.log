---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2.json) ------------------------------------
Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

## Formal statement
theorem algebra_manipexpr_apbeq2cceqiacpbceqm2:
  fixes a b c :: complex
  assumes h0 : "a+b = 2*c"
    and h1 : "c = \<i>"
  shows "a*c+b*c=-2"

## Structured informal proof

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: This proof involves manipulation of complex numbers. We need to carefully substitute the given values and use properties of complex numbers to simplify the expression.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Start with the expression $ac + bc$.
Step 2: Substitute $a + b = 2c$ into the expression to get $(a + b)c$.
Step 3: Use the fact that $c = i$ and simplify to obtain $2c^2 = 2i^2$.
Step 4: Simplify the expression to get $-2$ as the result.

I am hoping to translate step-by-step informal Isabelle proofs into formal ones. You previously tried to generate the below proof:

However, you encountered an error at step 1 where, specifically, you wrote have "a*c + b*c" due to the following reason:
Step error: Type unification failed: Clash of types "complex" and "bool"

Type error in application: incompatible operand type

Please provide an updated proof with your fix in a comment above that specific errored line. Please check for instance that Isabelle is able to deduce the types of all quantities, and that you are using sledgehammer as opposed to other proof methods. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same, or if you believe more detail may be necessary try to add a couple statements before the error in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle:
