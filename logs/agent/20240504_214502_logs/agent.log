---------------------New Problem (1: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_48.json) ------------------------------------
Simplify $(9-4i)-(-3-4i)$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
$(9-4i)- (-3-4i) = 9-4i +3 +4i = (9+3) + (-4i+4i) = 12$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_48:
  fixes q e :: complex
  assumes h0 : "q = Complex 9 (-4)"
    and h1 : "e = Complex (-3) (-4)"
  shows "q - e = 12"

I am hoping to fix an incorrectly generated Isabelle proof when given the location and reason for one of its errors. Here is an example:

## Incorrect Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"
    by simp
qed

## Last Statements
['\n  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)\n  ', 'show "(17 * 18) mod 4 = 2"', 'by simp']
In Step 1 of the proof's comments 

## Reason
Step error: Failed to apply initial proof method (line 1):
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. (17::'a) * (18::'a) mod (4::'a) = (2::'a)
At command "by" (line 1)

## Fixed Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  (* CHANGE: include types so they aren't over general 'a *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)" 
    (* CHANGE: try using sledgehamer since 'by simp' failed *)
    sledgehammer 
qed

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. Try to make use of sledgehammer as much as possible. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure needed facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for step with the specified error.

Now similarly fix the below Isabelle proof. Try to make use of sledgehammer as much as possible. If the error is simply that sledgehammer is not able to find a proof of your statement, try to see if the proof can be simplified so that not as much detail is needed but the high level steps still remain the same. If you believe more detail may be necessary, try to add a couple statements before the error to make sure needed facts are used or in order to clarify the proof further to Isabelle. Make sure to provide the entire full proof again (along with the theorem statement) with your changes and add comments that begin with CHANGE to indicate why you make the changes that you do. Please focus on making changes for step with the specified error.
