---------------------New Problem (151: data/full_data/valid/mathd_algebra_119.json) ------------------------------------
Solve for $e$, given that $2d$ is $8$ less than $17e$, and $2e$ is $9$ less than $d$. Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
We begin with a system of two equations \begin{align*}
2d&=17e-8
\\2e&=d-9
\end{align*}Since the second equation can also be rewritten as $d=2e+9$, we can plug this expression for $d$ back into the first equation and solve for $e$ \begin{align*}
2d&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 2(2e+9)&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad 4e+18&=17e-8
\\\Rightarrow \qquad -13e&=-26
\\\Rightarrow \qquad e&=2.
\end{align*}

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_119:
  fixes d e :: real
  assumes h0 : "2 * d = 17 * e - 8"
    and h1 : "2 * e = d - 9"
  shows "e = 2"

----------------Structured Proof (Attempt 1)-------------------
Notes for Structured proof: In this problem, the key step is to manipulate the given equations to eliminate one of the variables, leading to a direct solution for $e$. The equations must be substituted carefully to avoid errors in the calculation.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 5
Step 1: Rewrite the given system of equations as $2d = 17e - 8$ and $2e = d - 9$.
Step 2: Substitute $d = 2e + 9$ from the second equation into the first equation, yielding $2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8$.
Step 3: Solve the resulting equation to find $e = 2$.
