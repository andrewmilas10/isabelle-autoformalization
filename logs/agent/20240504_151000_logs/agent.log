Given that $a+b = 2c$ and $c = \text{Im}(1)$, show that $ac+bc=-2$.

## Informal proof
We have $ac + bc = (a+b)c=2c^2=2i^2=-2$

For each positive integer $n$, let $n!$ denote the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.

What is the remainder when $9!$ is divided by $10$? Show that it is 0.

## Informal proof
Notice that $10=2\cdot 5$. Both are factors of $9!$, so the remainder is $0$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_739:
  "(fact 9) mod 10 = (0::nat)"

If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c ^ d$, what is the value of $b$ such that $F(4, b, 2, 3) = 12$? Show that it is 1.

## Informal proof
Plugging in, we have that $4^b + 2^3 = 12$.  This rearranges to $4^b = 4$, or $b = 1$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_algebra_59:

Step 1: Substitute the values into the function $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c^d$ to get $4^b + 2^3 = 12$.
Step 2: Rearrange the equation to obtain $4^b = 4$.
Step 3: Solve for $b$ to find $b = 1$.
