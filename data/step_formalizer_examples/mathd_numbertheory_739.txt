## Problem
For each positive integer $n$, let $n!$ denote the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot (n-1)\cdot n$.

## Structured informal proof
Notes for Structured proof: Although informally this is simple, we need to be careful when formalizing that the type of numbers are consistently given per statement, and we need to make explicit how $2$ and $5$ dividing $9!$ guarantees $10$ divides $9!$ since $10=lcm(2,5)$.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 3
Step 1: Note that $2$ and $5$ are both factors of $9!$.
Step 2: Use the fact the lcm is a "least" common multiple to get that $10$ divides $9!$ and conclude the proof.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_739:
  "(fact 9) mod 10 = (0::nat)"

## Isabelle Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_739:
  "(fact 9) mod 10 = (0::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Note that $2$ and $5$ are both factors of $9!$. *)
  have "(5::nat) dvd (fact 9)"
    sledgehammer
  moreover have "(2::nat) dvd (fact 9)"
    sledgehammer
  (* Step 2: Use the fact the lcm is a "least" common multiple to get that $10$ divides $9!$ and conclude the proof. *)
  ultimately have "(10::nat) dvd (fact 9)"
    using lcm_least_iff
    sledgehammer
  thus ?thesis
    sledgehammer
