## Problem
If $321_{b}$ is equal to the base 10 integer 57, find $b$ given that $b>0$. Show that it is 4.

## Structured informal proof
Notes for Structured proof: In the formal statement, we are already given the quadratic, so solving the problem reduces to factoring it and taking the positive root which Isabelle can do easily.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 2
Step 1: From the quadratic equation given as assumption h1, we can factor to find $(3b+14)(b-4)=0$.
Step 2: Since we know that $b>0$, the only option is that $b=4$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_48:
  fixes b :: real
  assumes h0 : "0<b"
    and h1 : "3 * b^2 + 2 * b + 1 = 57"
  shows "b=4"

## Isabelle Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_48:
  fixes b :: real
  assumes h0 : "0<b"
    and h1 : "3 * b^2 + 2 * b + 1 = 57"
  shows "b=4"
proof -
  (* Step 1: From the quadratic equation given as assumption h1, we can factor to find $(3b+14)(b-4)=0$ *)
  have factorized: "(3 * b + 14) * (b - 4) = 0"
    using h1
    sledgehammer
  (* Step 2: Since we know that $b>0$, the only option is that $b=4$ *)
  thus ?thesis
    using h0
    sledgehammer
