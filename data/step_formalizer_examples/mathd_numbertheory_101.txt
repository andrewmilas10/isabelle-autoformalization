## Problem
Find the modulo 4 residue of $17 \cdot 18$. Show that it is 2.

## Structured informal proof
Notes for Structured proof: Isabelle can handle the computation easily. We just need to mak sure to provide the correct types so it knows they are given as natural numbers in this problem.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 1
Step 1: Directly show the result with included types

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"

## Isabelle Proof
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
proof -
  (* Step 1: Directly show the result with included types *)
  show "((17::nat) * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"
