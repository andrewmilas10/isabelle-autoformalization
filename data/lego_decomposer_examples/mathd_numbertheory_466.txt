## Problems
What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9? Show that it is 1.

## Informal proof
This is true by simple evaluation.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_466:\n  "(\\<Sum> k< 11. k) mod 9 = (1::nat)"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Calculate the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 9 + 10 = 55$.
Step 2: Divide 55 by 9. The remainder is 1.
