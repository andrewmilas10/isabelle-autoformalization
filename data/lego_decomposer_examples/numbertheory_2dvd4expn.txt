## Problems
Show that for positive integer n, 2 divides $4^n$.

## Informal proof
Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$. The conclusion thus follows.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n \<noteq> 0"
  shows "(2::nat) dvd 4^n"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$
