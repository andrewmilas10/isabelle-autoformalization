## Problems
Determine the value of $ab$ if $\log_8a+\log_4b^2=5$ and $\log_8b+\log_4a^2=7$. Show that it is 512.

## Informal proof
We first calculate that $\log_2=1$, $\log_4=2$, and $\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\log_a$ and $d=\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\frac{c}{3} + 2*\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\frac{d}{3} + 2*\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$. Multiply them together and $ab=512$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a b ::real
  assumes 
    "a > 0"
    "b > 0"
    "(log 2 a) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (b^2)) / (log 2 4) = 5"
    "(log 2 b) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (a^2)) / (log 2 4) = 7"
  shows "a * b = 512"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations, i.e., $\log_2 8 = 3$, $\log_2 4 = 2$.
Step 2: Define $c = \log_2 a$ and $d = \log_2 b$ to simplify the equations.
Step 3: Rewrite the original equations in terms of c and d using the calculated base 2 logarithms. The equations become $\frac{c}{3} + \frac{2d}{2} = 5$ and $\frac{d}{3} + \frac{2c}{2} = 7$.
Step 4: Solve the linear equations to find that $c = 6$ and $d = 3$.
Step 5: Use the values of c and d to find $a = 2^6 = 64$ and $b = 2^3 = 8$.
Step 6: Finally, show that $a * b = 64 * 8 = 512$ to conclude the proof.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
It would be particularly helpful to have experience solving systems of linear equations since it required to solve the linear equations in step 4.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma find_a_b_value:
  fixes c d :: real
  assumes 
    "c/3 + d/1 = 5"
    "d/3 + c/1 = 7"
  shows "c = 6 \<and> d = 3"
```

### Thoughts 2
It would be helpful for step 1 if there exists lemma that calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations. 

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma log_base_to_power_equals_exponent:
  fixes a :: real
  assumes "a > 0" "a \<noteq> 1" "n > 0"
  shows "log a (a^n) = n"
```

### Thoughts 3
In step 5 they uses the log definition to calculate the value of a and b, which require to calculate the antilogarithm_identity which calculate the value of $b = a^c$ given $log_a b = c$

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma antilogarithm_identity:
  assumes "a > 0" and "a \<noteq> 1" and "b > 0" and "log a b = c"
  shows "b = a ^ c"
```
