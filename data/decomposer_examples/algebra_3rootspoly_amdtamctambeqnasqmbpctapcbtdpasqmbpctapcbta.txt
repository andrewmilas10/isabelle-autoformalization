## Problems
Show that for any four complex numbers a, b, c, and d, $(a-d)(a-c)(a-b) = -(((a^2 - a(b+c)) + bc) * d) + (a^2 - a(b+c) + bc) * a$.

## Informal proof
We first see that $a^2 = a * a$ trivially. Unfolding this, the main equation holds true when terms are rearranged.

## Formal statement
theorem
  fixes a b c d :: complex
  shows "(a-d) * (a-c) * (a-b) = -(((a^2 - (b+c) * a) + c * b) * d) + (a^2 - (b+c) * a + c * b) * a"

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Recognize that $a^2 = a * a$, which is a trivial identity.
Step 2: Expand the left-hand side of the equation $(a-d)(a-c)(a-b)$ using distributive laws.
Step 3: Expand the right-hand side of the equation $-(((a^2 - a(b+c)) + bc) * d) + (a^2 - a(b+c) + bc) * a$ using distributive laws.
Step 4: Compare the expanded left-hand side and right-hand side to show that they are equivalent. Conclude that the main equation holds true.
