## Problems
What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits? Show that it is 18.

## Informal proof
We simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number. Hence $a$ is 1. The two-digit integer is hence $18$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.
Step 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.
Step 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.
Step 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
The solver needs to be comfortable working with Diophantine equations and natural numbers to find integer solutions for the given equation.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma find_a_b_integer_solution:
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes 
    "1 \<le> a \<and> a \<le> 9 \<and> b \<le> 9"
    "10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)"
  shows "a = 1 \<and> b = 8"
