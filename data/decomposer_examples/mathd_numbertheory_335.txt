## Problems
When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7? Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n mod 7 = 5"
  shows "(5 * n) mod 7 = 4"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Define Rachel's favorite number as $ n $.
Step 2. since $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \pmod{7}$
Step 3: Use modular arithmetic to simplify $ 5n (\text{mod} 7) $ into 4.
Step 4: Conclude that the remainder will be 4.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
Understanding of modular arithmetic will be crucial, as the proof relies heavily on understanding how remainders behave under multiplication.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma mod_multiply:
  fixes a b c m :: nat
  assumes "a mod m = b"
  shows "(c * a) mod m = (c * b) mod m"
```
