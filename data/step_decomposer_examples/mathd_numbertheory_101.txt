## Problem
Find the modulo 4 residue of $17 \cdot 18$. Show that it is 2.

## Informal proof
$17 \cdot 18 \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.

## Formal statement
theorem mathd_numbertheory_101:
  "(17 * 18) mod 4 = (2::nat)"

## Structured informal proof
Notes for Structured proof: Isabelle can handle the computation easily. We just need to mak sure to provide the correct types so it knows they are given as natural numbers in this problem.
Estimated Isabelle Proof Difficulty: 1
Step 1: Directly show the result with included types
