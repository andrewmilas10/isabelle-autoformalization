## Problems
Find the minimum value of $\frac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Step 1: Define a new variable y as x * sin(x) to simplify the expression.
Step 2: Our new goal becomes showing that 12 <= (9 * y^2 + 4) / y
Step 3: Prove that y is greater than 0, given the constraints on x.
Step 4: Using Sum of Squares (SoS) techniques, show that 9 * y^2 + 4 >= 12 * y.
Step 5: Re-express the inequality in terms of x and sin(x) to conclude the proof.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p9:
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"
```

proof -
  (* Step 1: Define a new variable y as x * sin(x) to simplify the expression. *)
  define y where "y=x * sin x"
  (* Step 2: Our new goal becomes showing that 12 <= (9 * y^2 + 4) / y *)
  have "12 \<le> (9 * y^2 + 4) / y"
