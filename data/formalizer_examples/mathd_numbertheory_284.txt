## Problems
What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits? Show that it is 18.

## Informal proof
Step 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.
Step 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.
Step 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.
Step 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_284:
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"
```

## Proof
```isabelle

(* no helper function required in this theorem *)

(* formal statement copy from the input *)
theorem mathd_numbertheory_284:
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"
proof -
  (* Step 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. *)
  have c0: "8 * a = b" using h1 sledgehammer

  (* Step 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8. *)
  hence "b \<ge> 8" using h0 sledgehammer

  (* Step 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints. *)
  hence c1:"b = 8" using h0 c0
    sledgehammer
  hence "a = 1" using c0 sledgehammer

  (* Step 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$. *)
  then show ?thesis using c1 sledgehammer
