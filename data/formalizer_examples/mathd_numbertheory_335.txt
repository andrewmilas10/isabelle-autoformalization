## Problems
When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7? Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Step 1: Define Rachel's favorite number as $ n $.
Step 2. since $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \pmod{7}$
Step 3: Use modular arithmetic to simplify $ 5n (\text{mod} 7) $ into 4.
Step 4: Conclude that the remainder will be 4.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_335:
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n mod 7 = 5"
  shows "(5 * n) mod 7 = 4"
```

  (* Step 3: Use modular arithmetic to simplify $ 5n (\text{mod} 7) $ into 4. *)
  then have "\<dots> = 4" sledgehammer
  then have "(5 * n) mod 7 = 4" using c0 

  (* Step 4: Conclude that the remainder will be 4. *)
  then show ?thesis sledgehammer
