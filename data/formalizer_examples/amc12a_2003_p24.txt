## Problems
If $a\geq b > 1,$ what is the largest possible value of $\log_{a}(a/b) + \log_{b}(b/a)?$  $ \mathrm{(A)}\ -2      \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ 0     \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ 2      \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ 3      \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ 4 $ Show that it is \textbf{B}.

## Informal proof
Step 1: Introduce variables x and y to represent the natural logarithms of a and b respectively.
Step 2: Given that \(b > 1\), conclude that the natural logarithm of b, \(y\), is greater than 0.
Step 3: Using the given assumptions, establish that \(x \ge y\). This implies \(x > 0\).
Step 4: Express the LHS of the main inequality in terms of x and y.
Step 5: Simplify the expression derived in Step 4.
Step 6: Demonstrate that the above expression is less than or equal to 0. The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM) is used here to argue that the term \((y/x + x/y)\) is at least 2, hence the expression is at most 0.

proof -

    using assms by simp
  have c1:"sqrt(y/x) \<ge> 0"
    using assms by simp
  have "x/y + y/x >= 2 * sqrt(x/y) * sqrt(y/x)"
