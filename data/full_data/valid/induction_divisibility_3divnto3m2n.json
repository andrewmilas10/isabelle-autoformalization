The result is trivial for $n=0$. Let us assume it is true for $n \\geq 0$.\nWe have $(n+1)^3+2(n+1) = (n^3+3n^2+3n+1) + (2n+2) = n^3+2n + 3n^2+3n+3$. From the induction hypothesis, we know that $3$ divides $n^3+2n$. Since $3$ also divides $3n^2+3n+3$, the result is also true in $n+1$ and we have by induction that the result is true for all $n$.", "formal_statement": "theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n:\n  fixes n::nat\n  shows \"3 dvd n^3 + 2 * n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n\n imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n:\n  fixes n::nat\n  shows \"3 dvd n^3 + 2 * n\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n"}
