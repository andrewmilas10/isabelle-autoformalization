Show that it is 11.", "informal_proof": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive divisors. Thus we must count the number of primes between 1 and $\\sqrt{1000}$ (the squares of these primes are all the natural numbers less than 1000 that have exactly three positive divisors).
