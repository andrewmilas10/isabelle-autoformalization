Show that it is 0.", "informal_proof": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $0$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_370:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"n mod 7 = (3::nat)\"\n  shows \"(2*n+1) mod 7 = (0::nat)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_370 imports\nComplex_Main\n\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_370:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"n mod 7 = (3::nat)\"\n  shows \"(2*n+1) mod 7 = (0::nat)\"\n  sorry\n\n\nend"}
