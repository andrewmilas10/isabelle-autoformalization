Therefore, if the surface area of a cube increases by a factor of $2$, its side length must increase by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, meaning the new side length of the cube is $1 * \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$. So, its volume is $({\\sqrt{2}})^3 = 2\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow\\mathrm{(C)}$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2008_p8:\n  fixes x y::real\n  assumes h0: \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y\"\n    and h1: \"y^3 = 1\"\n    and h2: \"6 * x^2 = 2 * (6 * y^2)\"\n  shows \"x^3 = 2 * sqrt 2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2008_p8 imports\nComplex_Main\nbegin\ntheorem amc12a_2008_p8:\n  fixes x y::real\n  assumes h0: \"0 < x \\<and> 0 < y\"\n    and h1: \"y^3 = 1\"\n    and h2: \"6 * x^2 = 2 * (6 * y^2)\"\n  shows \"x^3 = 2 * sqrt 2\"\n  using assms\n  by (smt (verit, best) mult_cancel_left2 one_power2 \n      power2_eq_square power2_le_imp_le \n      power2_sum power3_eq_cube power_Suc_less \n      power_commutes power_gt1_lemma real_le_lsqrt \n      real_le_rsqrt)\n\nend"}
