We know that its prime factors belong to the set $\\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$, as no factor of $10!$ has $11$ in its prime factorization, nor anything greater. Next, we must find exactly how many different possibilities exist for each.\n\nThere can be anywhere between $3$ and $8$ $2$'s and $1$ to $4$ $3$'s. However, since $n$ is a multiple of $5$, and we multiply the $\\text{gcd}$ by $5$, there can only be $3$ $5$'s in $n$'s prime factorization. Finally, there can either $0$ or $1$ $7$'s.\n\nThus, we can multiply the total possibilities of $n$'s factorization to determine the number of integers $n$ which satisfy the equation, giving us $6 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = \\textbf{(D) } 48$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2020_p21:\n  \"card {n :: nat. 5 dvd n \\<and> lcm (fact 5) n \n          = 5 * gcd (fact 10) n} = 48\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2020_p21 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n    \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12a_2020_p21:\n  \"card {n :: nat. 5 dvd n \\<and> lcm (fact 5) n \n          = 5 * gcd (fact 10) n} = 48\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
