Since the domain and the range of $f$ are the same, it follows that the domain of $f$ also satisfies $0 \\le x$.\n\nThe function has two zeroes at $x = 0, \\frac{-b}{a}$, which must be part of the domain. Since the domain and the range are the same set, it follows that $\\frac{-b}{a}$ is in the codomain of $f$, or $0 \\le \\frac{-b}{a}$. This implies that one (but not both) of $a,b$ is non-positive. The problem states that there is at least one positive value of b that works, thus $a$ must be non-positive, $b$ is non-negative, and the domain of the function occurs when $x(ax+b) > 0$, or \n\n<center>$0 \\le x \\le \\frac{-b}{a}.$</center>\n\n[[Completing the square]], $f(x) = \\sqrt{a\\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4a}} \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}}$ by the [[Trivial Inequality]] (remember that $a \\le 0$). Since $f$ is continuous and assumes this maximal value at $x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, it follows that the range of $f$ is \n\n<center>$0 \\le f(x) \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}}.$</center>\n\nAs the domain and the range are the same, we have that $\\frac{-b}{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}} = \\frac{b}{2\\sqrt{-a}} \\Longrightarrow a(a+4) = 0$ (we can divide through by $b$ since it is given that $b$ is positive). Hence $a = 0, -4$, which both we can verify work, and the answer is $\\mathbf{(C)}$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2003_p25:\n  fixes a b::real and f ::\"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes \"b>0\"  \n    and \"\\<forall> x. f x = sqrt (a * x^2 + b * x)\"\n    and \"{x. 0 \\<le> f x} = f ` {x. 0 \\<le> f x}\"\n  shows \"a=0 \\<or> a = -4\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2003_p25 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12a_2003_p25:\n  fixes a b::real and f ::\"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes \"b>0\"  \n    and \"\\<forall> x. f x = sqrt (a * x^2 + b * x)\"\n    and \"{x. 0 \\<le> f x} = f ` {x. 0 \\<le> f x}\"\n  shows \"a=0 \\<or> a = -4\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n"}
