{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_42", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "What is the sum of the smallest and second-smallest positive integers $a$ satisfying the congruence $$27a\\equiv 17 \\pmod{40}~?$$ Show that it is 62.", "informal_proof": "Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\\cdot 3 = 81\\equiv 1\\pmod{40}$.\n\nTo solve the congruence $27a\\equiv 17\\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \\begin{align*}\n3\\cdot 27a &\\equiv 3\\cdot 17 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{40}\n\\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $62$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_42:\n  fixes u v :: nat\n  assumes \"27 * u mod 40 = 17\"\n    and \"27 * v mod 40 = 17\"\n    and \"u < 40\"\n    and \"v < 80\"\n    and \"40 < v\" \n  shows \"(u + v) = 62\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_42 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_42:\n  fixes u v :: nat\n  assumes \"27 * u mod 40 = 17\"\n    and \"27 * v mod 40 = 17\"\n    and \"u < 40\"\n    and \"v < 80\"\n    and \"40 < v\" \n  shows \"(u + v) = 62\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
