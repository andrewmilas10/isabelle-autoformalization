{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_185", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "How many integers are in the solution of the inequality $|x + 4|< 9$? Show that it is 17.", "informal_proof": "If $x+4\\geq 0$ (or $x\\geq -4$), then the given inequality is the same as $x+4<9$ which means $x<5$. If $x+4<0$ (or $x<-4$), we have $-(x+4)<9$ which means $x+4>-9$ which yields $x>-13$. Thus, the solution is $-13<x<5$. Thus, the integers in this solution are -1 through -12 (12 integers), 1 through 4 (4 integers), and 0 (1 integer). Thus, the total is $12+4+1=17$ integers.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_185:\n  fixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x.
