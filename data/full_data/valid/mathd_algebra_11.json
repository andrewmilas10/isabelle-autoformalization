Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Let's play with the given condition a little. Clearing out the denominator gives $4a+3b=5(a-2b)=5a-10b$. Selectively combine like terms by adding $9b-4a$ to both sides to get $12b=a-b$. This gives $\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1$.\n\nNow, we want to find $\\dfrac{a+11b}{a-b}$. Rewrite this as $\\dfrac{a-b+12b}{a-b}=\\dfrac{a-b}{a-b}+\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1+1=2$, and we are done.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_11:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"a \\<noteq> b\"\n    and h1 : \"a \\<noteq> 2 * b\"\n    and h2 : \"(4*a+3*b) / (a-2*b) = 5\"\n  shows \"(a+11*b) / (a-b) = 2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_11 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_11:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"a \\<noteq> b\"\n    and h1 : \"a \\<noteq> 2 * b\"\n    and h2 : \"(4*a+3*b) / (a-2*b) = 5\"\n  shows \"(a+11*b) / (a-b) = 2\"\nproof -\n  have p0:\"a-b \\<noteq> 0\" using h0 by simp\n  have \"a-2*b \\<noteq> 0\" using h1 by simp\n  hence \"(4*a+3*b) = 5 * (a-2*b)\" using h2\n    by (metis Groups.mult_ac(2) nonzero_mult_div_cancel_left times_divide_eq_right)\n  also have \"5 * (a-2*b) = 5 * a - 10 * b\" by simp\n  ultimately have \"4*a+3*b = 5 * a - 10 * b\" by simp\n  hence h3: \"a=13*b\" by linarith\n  have \"a + 11 * b = 2 * (a-b)\" using p0 \n    unfolding h3 by auto\n  then show ?thesis using p0\n    by force\nqed\n\nend"}
