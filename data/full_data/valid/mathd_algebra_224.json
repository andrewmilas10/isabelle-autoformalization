How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition? Show that it is 8.", "informal_proof": "We have: $2 < \\sqrt{t} < \\frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $8$ possible integer values of $t$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_224:\n  \"card { n :: nat. sqrt n < 7 / 2 \\<and> 2 < sqrt n} = 8\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_224 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_224:\n  \"card { n :: nat. sqrt n < 7 / 2 \\<and> 2 < sqrt n} = 8\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
