Since this value is greater than or equal to -5, it satisfies both conditions. Thus, the only possible value of $x$ for which $f(x)=10$ is $6$, which means the sum of all possible values is also $6$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_149:\n  fixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes \"\\<forall> x < -5. f x = x^2 + 5\"\n    and \"\\<forall> x \\<ge> -5. f x = 3 * x -8\"\n  shows \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> (f -` {10}). k) = 6\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_149 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n    \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_149:\n  fixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes \"\\<forall> x < -5. f x = x^2 + 5\"\n    and \"\\<forall> x \\<ge> -5. f x = 3 * x -8\"\n  shows \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> (f -` {10}). k) = 6\" \n  sorry\n\nend   "}
