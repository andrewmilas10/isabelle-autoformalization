{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_257", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Cards are numbered from 1 to 100. One card is removed and the values on the other 99 are added. The resulting sum is a multiple of 77. What number was on the card that was removed? Show that it is 45.", "informal_proof": "The sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is \\[1 + 2 + \\dots + 100 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.\\] When this number is divided by 77, the remainder is 45.  Therefore, the number that was removed must be congruent to 45 modulo 77.\n\nHowever, among the numbers 1, 2, $\\dots$, 100, only the number $45$ itself is congruent to 45 modulo 77.  Therefore, this was the number of the card that was removed.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_257:\n  fixes x :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"1 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 100\"\n    and h1 : \"77 dvd ((\\<Sum>k::nat=0..100. k)-x)\"\n  shows \"x=45\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_257 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_257:\n  fixes x :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"1 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 100\"\n    and h1 : \"77 dvd ((\\<Sum>k::nat=0..100. k)-x)\"\n  shows \"x=45\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
