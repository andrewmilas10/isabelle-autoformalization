{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_214", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$. Show that it is 7.", "informal_proof": "Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+3\\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \\[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\\] so $a=\\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \\[y=\\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \\[y = \\frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=7.\\]", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_214:\n  fixes a :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = a * (x-2)^2 + 3\"\n    and h1 : \"f 4 = 4\"\n  shows \"f 6 = 7\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_214 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_214:\n  fixes a :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = a * (x-2)^2 + 3\"\n    and h1 : \"f 4 = 4\"\n  shows \"f 6 = 7\"\nproof -\n  have \"a * (4-2)^2 + 3 = 4\" using h1 h0[of 4] by simp\n  hence \"a = 1/4\" by simp\n  then show ?thesis unfolding h0[of 6] by simp\nqed\n\nend"}
