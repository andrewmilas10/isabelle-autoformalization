Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "First we multiply $(7j+3)$ by 3 to get $21j+9$. Now we divide by 7 and get $$\\frac{21j+9}{7}=3j+\\frac{9}{7}=3j+1+\\frac{2}{7}.$$ Since $j$ is an integer, we know that $3j+1$ is also an integer. We're left with the fraction $\\frac{2}{7}$ when we divided by 7, which means the remainder is $2$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_301:\n  fixes j :: nat \n  assumes \"j>0\"\n  shows \"(3 * (7 * j + 3)) mod 7 = 2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_301 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n    \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_301:\n  fixes j :: nat \n  assumes \"j>0\"\n  shows \"(3 * (7 * j + 3)) mod 7 = 2\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
