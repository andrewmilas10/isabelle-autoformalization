As there are only $100$ pairs of digits, sooner or later a pair of consecutive digits will occur for the second time. As each next digit only depends on the previous two, from this point on the sequence will be periodic.\n\n(Additionally, as every two consecutive digits uniquely determine the <i>previous</i> one as well, the first pair of digits that will occur twice must be the first pair $4,7$.)\n\nHence it is a good idea to find the period. Writing down more terms of the sequence, we get:\n\n$4,7,1,8,9,7,6,3,9,2,1,3,4,7,\\dots$\n\nand we found the period. The length of the period is $12$, and its sum is $4+7+\\cdots+1+3 = 60$. Hence for each $k$ we have $S_{12k} = 60k$.\n\nWe have $\\lfloor 10000/60 \\rfloor = 166$ and $166\\cdot 12 = 1992$, therefore $S_{1992} = 60\\cdot 166 = 9960$.\nThe rest can now be computed by hand, we get $S_{1998} = 9960+4+7+1+8+9+7= 9996$, and $S_{1999}=9996 + 6 = 10002$, thus the answer is $(B)1999$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2002_p21:\n  fixes u:: \"nat\\<Rightarrow>nat\" and n::nat\n  assumes \"u 0 =4\"\n    and \"u 1=7\"\n    and \"\\<forall> n \\<ge> 2. u (n + 2) = (u n + u (n + 1)) mod 10\"\n    and \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {..n}. u k) > 10000\"\n  shows \"1999 \\<le> n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2002_p21 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12a_2002_p21:\n  fixes u:: \"nat\\<Rightarrow>nat\" and n::nat\n  assumes \"u 0 =4\"\n    and \"u 1=7\"\n    and \"\\<forall> n \\<ge> 2. u (n + 2) = (u n + u (n + 1)) mod 10\"\n    and \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {..n}. u k) > 10000\"\n  shows \"1999 \\<le> n\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
