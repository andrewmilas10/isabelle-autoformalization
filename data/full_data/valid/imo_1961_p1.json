Give the conditions that $a $ and $b $ must satisfy so that $x, y, z $ (the solutions of the system) are distinct positive numbers.", "informal_proof": "Note that $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = (x+y)^2 - 2z^2 $, so the first two equations become\n<center>\n$\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\quad (x + y) + z \\!\\!\\! &= a \\; \\; (*) \\\\\n(x+y)^2 - z^2 \\!\\!\\! &=b^2 (**)\n\\end{matrix}\n$.\n</center>\n\nWe note that $(x+y)^2 - z^2 = \\Big[ (x+y)+z \\Big]\\Big[ (x+y)-z\\Big] $, so if $a $ equals 0, then $b $ must also equal 0.  We then have $ x+y = -z $; $xy = (x+y)^2 $.  This gives us $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0 $.  Mutiplying both sides by $(x-y) $, we have $x^3 - y^3 = 0 $.  Since we want $x,y $ to be real, this implies $x = y $.  But $x^2 + x^2 + x^2 $ can only equal 0 when $x=0 $ (which, in this case, implies $y,z = 0 $).  Hence there are no positive solutions when $a = 0 $.\n\nWhen $a \\neq 0 $, we divide $(**) $ by $(*) $ to obtain the system of equations\n<center>\n$\n\\begin{matrix}\n(x+y)+z &= a \\; \\quad \\\\\n(x+y)-z &= b^2/a\n\\end{matrix}\n$,\n</center>\nwhich clearly has solution $ x+y = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a} $, $ z = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a} $.  In order for these both to be positive, we must have positive $a $ and $a^2 > b^2 $.  Now, we have $ x+y = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a} $; $ xy = \\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 $, so $x,y $ are the roots of the quadratic $ m^2 - \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}m + \\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 $.  The [[discriminant]] for this equation is\n<center>\n$\n\\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\left(2\\frac{a^2 -b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{ (3a^2 - b^2)(3b^2 - a^2) }{4a^2}\n$.\n</center>\nIf the expressions $(3a^2 - b^2), (3b^2 - a^2) $ were simultaneously negative, then their sum, $2(a^2 + b^2) $, would also be negative, which cannot be.  Therefore our quadratic's discriminant is positive when $3a^2 > b^2 $ and $3b^2 > a^2 $.  But we have already replaced the first inequality with the sharper bound $a^2 > b^2 $.  It is clear that both roots of the quadratic must be positive if the discriminant is positive (we can see this either from $ \\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 > \\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\left(2\\frac{a^2 -b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 $ or from [[Polynomial#Descartes.27_Law_of_Signs | Descartes' Rule of Signs]]).  We have now found the solutions to the system, and determined that it has positive solutions if and only if $a $ is positive and $3b^2 > a^2 > b^2 $.
