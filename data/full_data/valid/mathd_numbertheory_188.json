Show that it is 12.", "informal_proof": "If a number $d$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, it must also divide into their difference. Thus, $d$ will be divisible by $180 - 168 = 12$. We notice that $12$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, so it follows that $12$ must be the GCF of $180$ and $168$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_188:\n  \"gcd 180 168 = (12::nat)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_188 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_188:\n  \"gcd 180 168 = (12::nat)\"\n  by eval\n\n\nend"}
