That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $1.$", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_466:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k< 11. k) mod 9 = (1::nat)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_466 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_466:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k< 11. k) mod 9 = (1::nat)\"\n  by eval\n\nend   "}
