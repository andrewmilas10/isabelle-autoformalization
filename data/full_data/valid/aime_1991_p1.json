Then $a + b = 71$ and $ab = 880$. Solving these two equations yields a [[quadratic equation|quadratic]]: $a^2 - 71a + 880 = 0$, which [[factor]]s to $(a - 16)(a - 55) = 0$. Either $a = 16$ and $b = 55$ or $a = 55$ and $b = 16$. For the first case, it is easy to see that $(x,y)$ can be $(5,11)$ (or vice versa). In the second case, since all factors of $16$ must be $\\le 16$, no two factors of $16$ can sum greater than $32$, and so there are no integral solutions for $(x,y)$. The solution is $5^2 + 11^2 = 146$.", "formal_statement": "theorem aime_1991_p1:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"0<x \\<and> 0<y\"\n    and h1 : \"x*y + (x+y) = 71\"\n    and h2 : \"x^2 * y + x * y^2=880\"\n  shows \"x^2 + y^2=146\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory aime_1991_p1 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem aime_1991_p1:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"0<x \\<and> 0<y\"\n    and h1 : \"x*y + (x+y) = 71\"\n    and h2 : \"x^2 * y + x * y^2=880\"\n  shows \"x^2 + y^2=146\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
