{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_144", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "How many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence? Show that it is 9.", "informal_proof": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $9$ possible triangles.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_144:\n  fixes a b c d :: nat\n  assumes h0:\"c - b = d\"\n    and h1:\"b - a = d\"\n    and h2: \"a+b+c = 60\"\n    and h3: \"a + b > c\"\n  shows \"d < 10\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_144 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_144:\n  fixes a b c d :: nat\n  assumes h0:\"c - b = d\"\n    and h1:\"b - a = d\"\n    and h2: \"a+b+c = 60\"\n    and h3: \"a + b > c\"\n  shows \"d < 10\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
