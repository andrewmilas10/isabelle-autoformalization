{"problem_name": "imo_1965_p1", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Determine all values $x$ in the interval $0\\leq x\\leq 2\\pi $ which satisfy the inequality\n$2\\cos x \\leq \\left| \\sqrt{1+\\sin 2x} - \\sqrt{1-\\sin 2x } \\right| \\leq \\sqrt{2}.$", "informal_proof": "We shall deal with the left side of the inequality first ($2\\cos x \\leq \\left| \\sqrt{1+\\sin 2x} - \\sqrt{1-\\sin 2x } \\right| $) and the right side after that.\n\nIt is clear that the left inequality is true when $\\cos x$ is non-positive, and that is when $x$ is in the interval $[\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2]$. We shall now consider when $\\cos x$ is positive. We can square the given inequality, and the resulting inequality will be true whenever the original left inequality is true. $4\\cos^2{x}\\leq 1+\\sin 2x+1-\\sin 2x-2\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2 2x}=2-2\\sqrt{\\cos^2{2x}}$. This inequality is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1-\\left| \\cos 2x\\right|$. I shall now divide this problem into cases.\n\nCase 1: $\\cos 2x$ is non-negative. This means that $x$ is in one of the intervals $[0,\\pi/4]$ or $[7\\pi/4, 2\\pi]$. We must find all $x$ in these two intervals such that $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1-\\cos 2x$. This inequality is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 2\\sin^2 x$, which is only true when $x=\\pi/4$ or $7\\pi/4$.\n\nCase 2: $\\cos 2x$ is negative. This means that $x$ is in one of the interavals $(\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$ or $(3\\pi/2, 7\\pi/4)$. We must find all $x$ in these two intervals such that $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 1+\\cos 2x$, which is equivalent to $2\\cos^2 x\\leq 2\\cos^2 x$, which is true for all $x$ in these intervals.\n\nTherefore the left inequality is true when $x$ is in the union of the intervals $[\\pi/4, \\pi/2)$, $(3\\pi/2, 7\\pi/4]$, and $[\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2]$, which is the interval $[\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4]$. We shall now deal with the right inequality.\n\nAs above, we can square it and have it be true whenever the original right inequality is true, so we do that. $2-2\\sqrt{\\cos^2{2x}}\\leq 2$, which is always true. Therefore the original right inequality is always satisfied, and all $x$ such that the original inequality is satisfied are in the interval $[\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4]$.", "formal_statement": "theorem imo_1965_p1:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes \"0 \\<le> x\"\n    and \"x \\<le> 2 * pi\"\n    and \"2 * cos x \\<le> abs (sqrt (1 + sin (2 * x)) \n          - sqrt (1 - sin (2 * x)))\"\n    and \"abs (sqrt (1 + sin (2 * x)) - sqrt (1 - sin (2 * x))) \\<le> sqrt 2\" \n  shows \"pi / 4 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 7 * pi / 4\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory imo_1965_p1 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem imo_1965_p1:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes \"0 \\<le> x\"\n    and \"x \\<le> 2 * pi\"\n    and \"2 * cos x \\<le> abs (sqrt (1 + sin (2 * x)) \n          - sqrt (1 - sin (2 * x)))\"\n    and \"abs (sqrt (1 + sin (2 * x)) - sqrt (1 - sin (2 * x))) \\<le> sqrt 2\" \n  shows \"pi / 4 \\<le> x \\<and> x \\<le> 7 * pi / 4\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
