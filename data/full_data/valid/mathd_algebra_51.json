How many more dollars than Larry does Lenny have? Show that it is 15.", "informal_proof": "Call the amount of money Larry has $a$ and the amount of money Lenny has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 35 \\\\\na &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot b \\\\\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $\\frac{2}{5} b + b = 35$. Solving for $b$ gives $\\frac{7}{5} b = 35$, or $b = 25$. Thus, $a = 35 - 25 = 10$. So Lenny has $25 - 10 = 15$ more dollars than Larry.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_51:\n  fixes a b ::real\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b\"\n    and \"a + b = 35\"\n    and \"a = (2/5) * b\"\n  shows \"b - a = 15\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\ntheory mathd_algebra_51 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_51:\n  fixes a b ::real\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b\"\n    and \"a + b = 35\"\n    and \"a = (2/5) * b\"\n  shows \"b - a = 15\"\n  using assms by auto\n\nend"}
