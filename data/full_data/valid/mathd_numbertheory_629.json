{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_629", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Suppose $t$ is a positive integer such that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,t]^3=(12t)^2$. What is the smallest possible value for $t$? Show that it is 18.", "informal_proof": "Recall the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Applying this identity to $12$ and $t$, we obtain $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,t]\\cdot \\gcd(12,t) = 12t,$$and so (cubing both sides) $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,t]^3 \\cdot \\gcd(12,t)^3 = (12t)^3.$$Substituting $(12t)^2$ for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,t]^3$ and dividing both sides by $(12t)^2$, we have $$\\gcd(12,t)^3 = 12t,$$so in particular, $12t$ is the cube of an integer. Since $12=2^2\\cdot 3^1$, the smallest cube of the form $12t$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3$, which is obtained when $t=2^1\\cdot 3^2 = 18$. This tells us that $t\\ge 18$.\n\nWe must check whether $t$ can be $18$. That is, we must check whether $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,18]^3=(12\\cdot 18)^2$. In fact, this equality does hold (both sides are equal to $6^6$), so the smallest possible value of $t$ is confirmed to be $18$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_629 :\n  \"(LEAST t::nat.
