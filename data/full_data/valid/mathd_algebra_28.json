{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_28", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "What is the largest number $c$ such that $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution? Express your answer as a common fraction. Show that it is \\frac{25}{8}.", "informal_proof": "In order for this quadratic to have at least one real solution, its discriminant must be non-negative. In other words, $b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(2)(c) = 25 - 8c \\ge 0$. Rearranging, we have $25 \\ge 8c$. Dividing by 8, we have $25/8 \\ge c$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ such that this quadratic has a real solution is $\\frac{25}{8}$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_28:\n  fixes c :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<forall>x. f x = 2 * x^2 + 5 * x + c\"\n    and h1 : \"\\<exists>x. f x \\<le> 0\"\n  shows \"c \\<le> 25/8\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_28 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_28:\n  fixes c :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<forall>x. f x = 2 * x^2 + 5 * x + c\"\n    and h1 : \"\\<exists>x. f x \\<le> 0\"\n  shows \"c \\<le> 25/8\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
