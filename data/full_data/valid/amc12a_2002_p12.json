It can be factored as $(x-r)(x-s)$ which is just $x^2-(r+s)x+rs$. Thus, the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of $x$ and the product is the constant term. (In general, this leads to [[Vieta's Formulas]]).\n\nWe now have that the sum of the two roots is $63$ while the product is $k$. Since both roots are primes, one must be $2$, otherwise the sum would be even. That means the other root is $61$ and the product must be $122$. Hence, our answer is $\\text{(B)}\\ 1$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2002_p12:\n  fixes f :: \"real => real\"\n    and k :: real and a b::nat\n  assumes \"\\<forall> x. f x = x^2 - 63 * x + k\"\n    and \"f -` {0} = {of_nat a, of_nat b}\"\n    and \"prime a\" and \"prime b\"\n  shows \"k=122\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2002_p12 imports\n  Complex_Main\n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12a_2002_p12:\n  fixes f :: \"real => real\"\n    and k :: real and a b::nat\n  assumes \"\\<forall> x. f x = x^2 - 63 * x + k\"\n    and \"f -` {0} = {of_nat a, of_nat b}\"\n    and \"prime a\" and \"prime b\"\n  shows \"k=122\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
