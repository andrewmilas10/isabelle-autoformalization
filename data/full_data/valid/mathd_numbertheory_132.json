Show that it is 0.", "informal_proof": "An integer is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  Because $2+0+0+4=6$ is divisible by 3, 2004 is divisible by 3.  Also, the last two digits of 2004 form a multiple of 4, so 2004 is divisible by 4 as well. Therefore, 2004 is divisible by 12 and hence leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by 12.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_132:\n  \"2004 mod 12 = (0::nat)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_132 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_132:\n  \"2004 mod 12 = (0::nat)\"\n  by eval\n    \n  \n\nend"}
