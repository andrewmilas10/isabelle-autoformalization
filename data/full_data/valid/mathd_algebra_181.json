Show that it is 11.", "informal_proof": "Multiplying both sides by $n-3$, we have $n+5 = 2(n-3)$.  Expanding gives $n+5 = 2n - 6$, and solving this equation gives $n=11$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_181:\n  fixes n :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"n \\<noteq> 3\"\n    and h1 : \"(n+5) / (n-3) = 2\"\n  shows \"n=11\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_181 imports\nComplex_Main\n\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_181:\n  fixes n :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"n \\<noteq> 3\"\n    and h1 : \"(n+5) / (n-3) = 2\"\n  shows \"n=11\"\nproof -\n  have \"n - 3 \\<noteq> 0\" using h0 by simp\n  hence \"n+5 = 2 * (n-3)\" using h1\n    by (metis nonzero_mult_div_cancel_right times_divide_eq_left)\n  hence \"n+5 = 2*n - 2*3\" by simp\n  hence \"5+2*3 = 2*n-n\" by simp\n  then show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\n\nend"}
