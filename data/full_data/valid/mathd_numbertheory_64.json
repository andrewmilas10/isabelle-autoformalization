{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_64", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $30x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{47}$? Show that it is 39.", "informal_proof": "Note that 6 divides both $30x$ and $42$, and since 6 is relatively prime to 47, we can write $5x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{47}$. Note that $5 \\cdot 19 = 95 = 2(47) + 1$, so 19 is the modular inverse of 5, modulo 47. We multiply both sides of the given congruence by 19 to obtain $95x \\equiv 19(7) \\pmod{47}\\implies x \\equiv 39 \\pmod{47}$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_64 :\n  \"(LEAST x ::nat.
