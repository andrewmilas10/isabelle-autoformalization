Show that it is 3.", "informal_proof": "First we find that the slope of the line is $\\frac{4 - 3}{7 - 6} = 1$.  Now, for any other point, $P = (x, y)$, to be on this line, the slope between $P$ and either of $(7, 4)$ or $(6, 3)$ must be equal to 1.  Thus $\\frac{y - 3}{x - 6} = 1 \\Rightarrow y = x - 3$.  A line crosses the $x$-axis when it has $y = 0$.  Plugging this in for our line we get $0 = x - 3 \\Rightarrow x = 3$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_43:\n  fixes a b :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = a * x + b\"\n    and h1 : \"f 7 = 4\"\n    and h2 : \"f 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"f 3 = 0\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_43 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_43:\n  fixes a b :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = a * x + b\"\n    and h1 : \"f 7 = 4\"\n    and h2 : \"f 6 = 3\"\n  shows \"f 3 = 0\"\nproof -\n  have \"f 7 = 7 * a + b\" using h0[of 7] by simp\n  hence p1: \"7 * a + b = 4\" using h1 by simp\n  have \"f 6 = 6 * a + b\" using h0[of 6] by simp\n  hence p2: \"6 * a + b = 3\" using h2 by simp\n  have \"a = 1 \\<and> b = -3\" using p1 p2 by linarith\n  then show ?thesis unfolding h0[of 3] by linarith\nqed\n\n\nend"}
