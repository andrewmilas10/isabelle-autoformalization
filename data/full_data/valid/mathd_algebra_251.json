{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_251", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Three plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number.  What is the number? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \\dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = 2$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_251:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes h0: \"x \\<noteq> 0\"\n    and h1: \"3 + 1/x = 7/x\"\n  shows \"x = 2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_251 imports\nComplex_Main\n\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_251:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes h0: \"x \\<noteq> 0\"\n    and h1: \"3 + 1/x = 7/x\"\n  shows \"x = 2\"\n  sorry\n\n\nend"}
