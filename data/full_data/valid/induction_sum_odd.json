The result is trivial for $n=1$. Let us assume it is true for $n \\geq 1$.\nWe have that $\\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} (2k + 1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1) + (2n + 1)$.\nThe induction hypothesis tells us that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1) = n^2$. So $\\sum_{k=0}^{(n+1)-1} (2k + 1) = n^2 + 2n +1 = (n+1)^2$ and the result is true for $n+1$.\nBy induction, we conclude that the result is true for all positive integer $n$.", "formal_statement": "theorem induction_sum_odd:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n > 0\"\n  shows \"(\\<Sum>(k::nat) = 0..(n-1). 2 * k + 1) = n^2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory induction_sum_odd imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem induction_sum_odd:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n > 0\"\n  shows \"(\\<Sum>(k::nat) = 0..(n-1). 2 * k + 1) = n^2\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
