How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form. Show that it is 187.5.", "informal_proof": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=187.5$ calories.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_104:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"125/8 = x /12\"\n  shows \"x = 375/2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_104 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_104:\n  fixes x :: real\n  assumes h0 : \"125/8 = x /12\"\n  shows \"x = 375/2\"\nproof -\n  have \"x = 12 * 125/8\" using h0 by simp\n  then show ?thesis by simp\nqed\n\nend"}
