{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_303", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "If $n>1$ is an integer, the notation $a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}$ means that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $n$. Find the sum of all possible values of $n$ such that both of the following are true: $171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$ and $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$. Show that it is 111.", "informal_proof": "As we are told, we want to find all values of $n>1$ such that $n$ divides into $171-80 = 91$ and $n$ also divides into $468 - 13 = 455$. We notice that $455 = 5 \\cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\\{1,7,13,91\\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = 111$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_303:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {n ::nat. 2 \\<le> n \\<and> [171 = 80] (mod n) \\<and> [468 = 13] (mod n)}. k) = 111\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_303 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n    \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_303:\n  \"(\\<Sum> k \\<in> {n ::nat. 2 \\<le> n \\<and> [171 = 80] (mod n) \\<and> [468 = 13] (mod n)}. k) = 111\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
