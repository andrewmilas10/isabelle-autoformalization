{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_405", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the sum $x^2+4x+4$ less than 20? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Note that since we can only use positive integers for $x$, the minimum will be x = 1.  Testing x = 2, we get $2^2 + 4\\cdot 2 + 4 = 16$.  Since $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, we know that only $x = 1,2$ will work, thus, there are $2$ positive integer values of $x$ such that this function is less than 20.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_405:\n  fixes x :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"0 < x\"\n    and h1 : \"x ^ 2 + 4 * x + 4 < 20\"\n  shows \"x = 1 \\<or> x = 2\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_405 imports\n  Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_405:\n  fixes x :: nat\n  assumes h0 : \"0 < x\"\n    and h1 : \"x ^ 2 + 4 * x + 4 < 20\"\n  shows \"x = 1 \\<or> x = 2\"\nproof -\n  have \"x ^ 2 + 4 * x + 4 = (x + 2)^2\"\n    by (simp add: numeral_Bit0)\n  hence \"(x+2)^2 < 20\" using h1 by simp\n  hence \"x+2 < sqrt 20\" using h0\n    by (metis of_nat_less_iff of_nat_numeral of_nat_power real_less_rsqrt)\n  hence h2: \"x < sqrt 20 - 2\" by simp\n  have \"20 < (25::nat)\" by simp\n  hence \"20 < (5::nat)^2\" by eval\n  hence \"sqrt 20 < (5::nat)\"\n    using real_less_lsqrt by force\n  hence \"sqrt 20 - 2 < 3\" by simp\n  hence \"x < 3\" using h2 by simp\n  then show ?thesis using h0 by force\nqed\n\nend"}
