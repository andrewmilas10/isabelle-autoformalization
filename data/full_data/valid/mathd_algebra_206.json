Show that it is -1.", "informal_proof": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b=0$ are given by $-a$ and $b$, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, we see that $2a+b = -a$ and $(2a)(b) = b$. From the second equation, we see that either $2a = 1$ or else $b = 0$. But if $b = 0$, then the first equation gives $2a = -a$, implying that $a = 0$. This makes the two solutions of our original polynomial the same, and we are given that they are distinct. Hence $b \\not=0$, so $2a = 1,$ or $a = 1/2$. Then $b = -3a = -3/2$, so $a+b = -1$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_206:\n  fixes a b :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = x^2 + a*x + b\"\n    and h1 : \"2 * a \\<noteq> b\"\n    and h2 : \"f (2 * a) = 0\"\n    and h3 : \"f b = 0\"\n  shows \"a + b = -1\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Albert Qiaochu Jiang\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_206 imports\nComplex_Main\n\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_206:\n  fixes a b :: real\n    and f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<And>x. f x = x^2 + a*x + b\"\n    and h1 : \"2 * a \\<noteq> b\"\n    and h2 : \"f (2 * a) = 0\"\n    and h3 : \"f b = 0\"\n  shows \"a + b = -1\"\n  sorry\n\n\nend"}
