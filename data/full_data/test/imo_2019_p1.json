Therefore, we know that $f(x) = 2x + c$ satisfies the above for any '''integral''' constant c, and that this family of equations is unique.", "formal_statement": "theorem imo_2019_p1:\n  fixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\" \n  shows \"\\<forall> a b. f (2 * a) + (2 * f b) = f (f (a + b)) \n              \\<longleftrightarrow> (\\<forall> z. f z = 0 \\<or> (\\<exists> c. \\<forall> z. f z = 2 * z + c))\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory imo_2019_p1\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem imo_2019_p1:\n  fixes f :: \"int \\<Rightarrow> int\" \n  shows \"(\\<forall> a b. f (2 * a) + (2 * f b) = f (f (a + b)))\n              \\<longleftrightarrow> (\\<forall> z. f z = 0 \\<or> (\\<exists> c. \\<forall> z. f z = 2 * z + c))\"\n  sorry \n\nend\n"}
