Show that it is (1,1).", "informal_proof": "We wish to solve for $a$ and $b$. First, multiply the second equation by $2$ and subtract it from the first. This gives $(3a - 2a) + (2b - 2b) = (5 - 4)$, or $a = 1$. Then, plugging $a = 1$ into the second equation yields $1 + b = 2$, so $b = 1$. Thus, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations is $(1,1)$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_513:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes \"3 * a + 2 * b = 5\"\n    and \"a + b = 2\" \n  shows \"a = 1 \\<and> b = 1\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_513 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_513:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes \"3 * a + 2 * b = 5\"\n    and \"a + b = 2\" \n  shows \"a = 1 \\<and> b = 1\"\n  using assms by auto\n\nend   "}
