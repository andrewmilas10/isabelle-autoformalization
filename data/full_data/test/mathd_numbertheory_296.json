Show that it is 4096.", "informal_proof": "If $n$ is a perfect cube, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $3$. If $n$ is a perfect fourth power, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $4$. The only way both of these statements can be true is for all the exponents to be divisible by $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3,4]=12$, so such an $n$ must be a perfect twelfth power. Since we aren't using $1^{12}=1,$ the next smallest is $2^{12}=4096.$", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_296:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"2 \\<le> n\"\n    and \"\\<exists> x. x^3 = n\"\n    and \"\\<exists> t. t^4 = n\" \n  shows \"4096 \\<le> n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_296 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_296:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"2 \\<le> n\"\n    and \"\\<exists> x. x^3 = n\"\n    and \"\\<exists> t. t^4 = n\" \n  shows \"4096 \\<le> n\"\n  sorry\n\n\nend "}
