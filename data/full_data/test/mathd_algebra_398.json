{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_398", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs? Show that it is 63.", "informal_proof": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $63$ ligs are equivalent.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_398:\n  fixes a b c ::real\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b \\<and> 0 < c\"\n    and \"9 * b = 20 * c\"\n    and \"7 * a = 4 * b\"\n  shows \"63 * a = 80 * c\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_398 imports \n  Complex_Main \n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_398:\n  fixes a b c ::real\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b \\<and> 0 < c\"\n    and \"9 * b = 20 * c\"\n    and \"7 * a = 4 * b\"\n  shows \"63 * a = 80 * c\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
