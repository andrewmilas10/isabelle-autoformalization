Show that it is -56.", "informal_proof": "Summing all three equations yields that $5a + 5b + 5c = -3 + 9 + 19 = 25$. Thus, $a + b + c = 5$. Subtracting this from each of the given equations, we obtain that $2a = -8, 2b = 4, 2c = 14$. Thus, $a = -4, b = 2, c =7$, and their product is $abc = -4 \\times 2 \\times 7 = -56$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_338:\n  fixes a b c :: real\n  assumes \"3 * a + b + c = -3\"\n    and \"a + 3 * b + c = 9\"\n    and \"a + b + 3 * c = 19\" \n  shows \"a * b * c = -56\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_338 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_338:\n  fixes a b c :: real\n  assumes \"3 * a + b + c = -3\"\n    and \"a + 3 * b + c = 9\"\n    and \"a + b + 3 * c = 19\" \n  shows \"a * b * c = -56\"\n  sorry\n\nend "}
