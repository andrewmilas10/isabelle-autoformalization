Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $575\\text{ students}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_137:\n  fixes x::nat\n  assumes \" x + 4 / 100 * x = 598\" \n  shows \"x = 575\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_137 imports \n  Complex_Main \n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_137:\n  fixes x::nat\n  assumes \" x + 4 / 100 * x = 598\" \n  shows \"x = 575\"\n  using assms by auto\n\nend"}
