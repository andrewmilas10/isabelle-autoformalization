{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_392", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "The sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers is $12296$. Find the product of the three numbers divided by $8$. Show that it is 32736.", "informal_proof": "If $n$ is the middle number of the three, the other two numbers are $n-2$ and $n+2$. Therefore, the squares are $n^2-4n+4$, $n^2$, and $n^2+4n+4$. Setting the sum of the three squares equal to $12296$, \\begin{align*}\n\\left(n^2-4n+4\\right)+\\left(n^2\\right)+\\left(n^2+4n+4\\right)&=12296\\\\\n3n^2+8&=12296\\\\\n3n^2&=12288\\\\\nn^2&=4096\\\\\nn&=\\pm64\n\\end{align*}Because $n$ is positive, $n$ must be $64$. Therefore, the set of numbers is $62, 64, 66$. The product of those is $261888$. The product divided by 8 is $32736$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_392:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"even n\"\n    and \"(n - 2)^2 + n^2 + (n + 2)^2 = (12296::int)\" \n  shows \"((n - 2) * n * (n + 2)) / 8 = (32736::int)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_392 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_392:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"even n\"\n    and \"(n - 2)^2 + n^2 + (n + 2)^2 = (12296::int)\" \n  shows \"((n - 2) * n * (n + 2)) / 8 = (32736::int)\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n    "}
