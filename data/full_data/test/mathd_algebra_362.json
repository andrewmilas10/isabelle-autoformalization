Show that it is \\frac83.", "informal_proof": "Rearranging the second equation, we have that $b^3=\\frac{4}{27}a$. If we substitute this into the original equation, we get $\\frac{4}{27}a^3=\\frac{32}{27}$; after multiplying each side by $\\frac{27}{4}$ and taking the cube root, we see that $a=2$. Substituting $a$ into the first equation, we get that $b^3=\\frac{8}{27}$ or $b=\\frac23$. Thus, $a+b=2+\\frac23=\\frac83$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_362:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes \"a^2 * b^3 = 32 / 27\"\n    and \"a / b^3 = 27 / 4\" \n  shows \"a + b = 8 / 3\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_362 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_362:\n  fixes a b :: real\n  assumes \"a^2 * b^3 = 32 / 27\"\n    and \"a / b^3 = 27 / 4\" \n  shows \"a + b = 8 / 3\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
