{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_541", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "The product of two positive whole numbers is 2005. If neither number is 1, what is the sum of the two numbers? Show that it is 406.", "informal_proof": "$2005=5\\cdot401$. Checking the primes less than $\\sqrt{401}$ as potential divisors, we see that 401 is prime. Thus, the positive whole numbers in question are 5 and 401. Their sum is $406.$", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_541:\n  fixes m n ::nat\n  assumes \"1 < m\"\n    and \"1 < n\"\n    and \"m * n = 2005\" \n  shows \"m + n = 406\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_541 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_541:\n  fixes m n ::nat\n  assumes \"1 < m\"\n    and \"1 < n\"\n    and \"m * n = 2005\" \n  shows \"m + n = 406\"\n  sorry\n\nend "}
