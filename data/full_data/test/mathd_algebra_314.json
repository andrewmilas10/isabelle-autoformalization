Show that it is \\frac{1}{4}.", "informal_proof": "By simplifying exponents, we have $2^{2n} = 4^n$.  So, our overall expression is $\\frac{4^n}{4^{n+1}}$.  This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{4}$.  Throughout the course of this calculation, we did not have to plug in the value of 11 for $n$, but the answer may be similarly obtained with this substitution.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_314:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n = 11\" \n  shows \"(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / (4::real)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_314 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_314:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n = 11\" \n  shows \"(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / (4::real)\"\n  unfolding assms by eval\n\nend "}
