The largest negative solution is $750-1199 = -449$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_765:\n  fixes x :: int\n  assumes \"x < 0\"\n    and \"(24 * x) mod 1199 = 15\"\n  shows \"x \\<le> -449\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_765 imports \n  Complex_Main \n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_765:\n  fixes x :: int\n  assumes \"x < 0\"\n    and \"(24 * x) mod 1199 = 15\"\n  shows \"x \\<le> -449\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
