{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_320", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Let $x$ be a positive number such that $2x^2 = 4x + 9.$ If $x$ can be written in simplified form as $\\dfrac{a + \\sqrt{b}}{c}$ such that $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, what is $a + b + c$? Show that it is 26.", "informal_proof": "First, we move all terms to one side to get $2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0.$ Seeing that factoring will not work, we apply the Quadratic Formula: \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(-9)}}{2 (2)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 72}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{88}}{4}\\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{22}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{22}}{2}.\n\\end{align*}Since $x$ is positive, $x$ can be written as $\\dfrac{2 + \\sqrt{22}}{2},$ so our answer is $2 + 22 + 2 = 26.$", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_320:\n  fixes x :: real\n    and a b c :: nat\n  assumes \"2 * x^2 = 4 * x + 9\"\n    and \"x = (a + sqrt b) / c\"\n    and \"x\\<ge>0\" \"a>0\" \"b>0\" \"c>0\"\n  shows \"a + b + c = 26\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_320 imports \n  Complex_Main \n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_320:\n  fixes x :: real\n    and a b c :: nat\n  assumes \"2 * x^2 = 4 * x + 9\"\n    and \"x = (a + sqrt b) / c\"\n    and \"x\\<ge>0\" \"a>0\" \"b>0\" \"c>0\"\n    and \"c = 2\"\n  shows \"a + b + c = 26\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n"}
