Show that it is 17.", "informal_proof": "We find the prime factorization of $80325$, which is $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17$. The largest prime in the factorization is $17$, so $n$ is at least 17. Since there are three factors of $3$, two factors of $5$, and one factor of $7$ in the prime factorization of $17!$, the minimum value of $n$ is $17$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_457:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"0 < n\"\n    and \"80325 dvd (fact n)\" \n  shows \"17 \\<le> n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_457 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_457:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"0 < n\"\n    and \"80325 dvd (fact n)\" \n  shows \"17 \\<le> n\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n    "}
