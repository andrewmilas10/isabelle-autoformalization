{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_495", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that the units digit of $a$ is $2$, the units digit of $b$ is $4$, and the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $6$.\n\nWhat is the smallest possible value of the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$? Show that it is 108.", "informal_proof": "Both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $6$, so the choices for $a$ are $$12, 42, 72, 102, 132, \\ldots\\phantom{~.}$$and the choices for $b$ are $$24, 54, 84, 114, 144, \\ldots~.$$We know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab$ (since this identity holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$). Therefore, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{6},$$so in order to minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we should make $ab$ as small as possible. But we can't take $a=12$ and $b=24$, because then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be $12$, not $6$. The next best choice is either $a=12,b=54$ or $a=42,b=24$. Either of these pairs yields $\\gcd(a,b)=6$ as desired, but the first choice, $a=12$ and $b=54$, yields a smaller product. Hence this is the optimal choice, and the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,54] = \\frac{12\\cdot 54}{6} = 2\\cdot 54 = 108.$$", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_495:\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b\"\n    and \"a mod 10 = 2\"\n    and \"b mod 10 = 4\"\n    and \"gcd a b = 6\"\n  shows \"108 \\<le> lcm a b\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_495 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_495:\n  fixes a b :: nat\n  assumes \"0 < a \\<and> 0 < b\"\n    and \"a mod 10 = 2\"\n    and \"b mod 10 = 4\"\n    and \"gcd a b = 6\"\n  shows \"108 \\<le> lcm a b\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n    "}
