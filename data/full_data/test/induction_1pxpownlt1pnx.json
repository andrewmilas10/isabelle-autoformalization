The result is trivial for $n=0$ or $n=1$. Let us assume the property is true in $n$.\nBy the induction hypothesis we know that $(1+nx)\\leq (1+x)^n$.\nMoreover, as $x > -1$, we have that $x \\leq x (1 + x)^n$. The inequality is trivial if $x \\geq 0$, and is also true if $x < 0$ as $-1 < x < 0 \\implies 0 < (1 + x)^n < 1$.\nSo, $(1+nx) + x \\leq (1+x)^n + x (1+x)^n$ and we have that $(1+(n+1)x) \\leq (1+x)^(n+1)$, so the property is true in $n+1$.\nBy induction, we have that the result is true for any natural number $n$.", "formal_statement": "theorem induction_1pxpownlt1pnx:\n  fixes x :: real and n :: nat\n  assumes \"-1 < x\"\n  shows \"(1 + n*x) \\<le> (1 + x)^n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory induction_1pxpownlt1pnx \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem induction_1pxpownlt1pnx:\n  fixes x :: real and n :: nat\n  assumes \"-1 < x\"\n  shows \"(1 + n*x) \\<le> (1 + x)^n\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
