{"problem_name": "amc12_2000_p6", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Two different prime numbers between $4$ and $18$ are chosen. When their sum is subtracted from their product, which of the following numbers could be obtained?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 22 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 60 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 119 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 180 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 231$ Show that it is \\textbf{(C) }119.", "informal_proof": "Any two prime numbers between 4 and 18 have an odd product and an even sum. Any odd number minus an even number is an odd number, so we can eliminate A, B, and D. Since the highest two prime numbers we can pick are 13 and 17, the highest number we can make is $(13)(17)-(13+17) = 221 - 30 = 191$. Thus, we can eliminate E. So, the answer must be $\\textbf{(C) }119$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12_2000_p6:\n  fixes p q ::nat\n  assumes h0: \"prime p \\<and> prime q\"\n    and h1: \"4 \\<le> p \\<and> p \\<le> 18\"\n    and h2: \"4 \\<le> q \\<and> q \\<le> 18\" \n  shows \"((p *  q)::int) - (p + q) \\<noteq> 194\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12_2000_p6\n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12_2000_p6:\n  fixes p q ::nat\n  assumes h0: \"prime p \\<and> prime q\"\n    and h1: \"4 \\<le> p \\<and> p \\<le> 18\"\n    and h2: \"4 \\<le> q \\<and> q \\<le> 18\" \n  shows \"((p *  q)::int) - (p + q) \\<noteq> 194\"\nproof -\n  have \"set (primes_upto 18) = set [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]\"\n    by eval\n  moreover have \"p\\<in>set (primes_upto 18)\" \"q\\<in>set (primes_upto 18)\"\n    using h1 h0 h2 unfolding set_primes_upto by auto\n  ultimately have \"p\\<in>{5,7,11,13,17}\" \"q\\<in>{5,7,11,13,17}\"\n    using h1 h2 by auto\n  then show ?thesis by auto\nqed\n\nend\n\n"}
