The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family? Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=5$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_227:\n  fixes x y n ::nat\n  assumes \"x / 4 + y / 6 = (x + y) / n\"\n    and \"n\\<noteq>0\" \"x\\<noteq>0\" \"y\\<noteq>0\"\n  shows \"n = 5\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_227 imports \n  Complex_Main \n  \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_227:\n  fixes x y n ::nat\n  assumes \"x / 4 + y / 6 = (x + y) / n\"\n    and \"n\\<noteq>0\" \"x\\<noteq>0\" \"y\\<noteq>0\"\n  shows \"n = 5\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
