{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_288", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "A point $(x,y)$ on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative is a distance of 6 units from the $x$-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point $(8,3)$. It is a distance $\\sqrt{n}$ from the origin. What is $n$? Show that it is 52.", "informal_proof": "We know that $y=-6$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}&=15 \\\\\nx^2-16x+64+81&=225 \\\\\nx^2-16x-80&=0 \\\\\n(x-20)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x+4=0$ or $x-20=0$, so $x=-4$ or $x=20$. $x=-4$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(-4,-6)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(-6)^2}=\\sqrt{52}$ units from the origin. $n=52$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_288:\n  fixes x y :: real\n    and n :: real\n  assumes \"x < 0 \\<and> y < 0\"\n    and \"abs x = 6\"\n    and \"sqrt ((x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2) = 15\"\n    and \"sqrt (x^2 + y^2) = sqrt n\"\n  shows \"n = 52\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_288 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_288:\n  fixes x y :: real\n    and n :: real\n  assumes \"x < 0 \\<and> y < 0\"\n    and \"abs y = 6\"\n    and \"sqrt ((x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2) = 15\"\n    and \"sqrt (x^2 + y^2) = sqrt n\"\n  shows \"n = 52\"\n  sorry\n\nend "}
