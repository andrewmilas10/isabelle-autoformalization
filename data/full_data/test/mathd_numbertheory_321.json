We want to use this to find the multiplicative inverse to $4\\cdot40=160$, so we want to try to \"divide\" 35 by 4.\n\nThe difficulty in dividing by 4 is that 35 is odd.  We do know, though, that  \\[35\\equiv35+1399\\equiv1434\\pmod{1399}\\]and this number is even!  Let's go even further, though, to find a multiple of 4: \\[35\\equiv35+3\\cdot1399\\equiv4232\\pmod{1399}.\\]Factoring 4 we get  \\[35\\equiv4\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]Finally we multiply by 40: \\[1\\equiv 40\\cdot35\\equiv40\\cdot4\\cdot1058\\equiv160\\cdot1058\\pmod{1399}.\\]This argument is inelegant.
