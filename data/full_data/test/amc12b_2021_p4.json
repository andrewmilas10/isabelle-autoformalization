{"problem_name": "amc12b_2021_p4", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Ms. Blackwell gives an exam to two classes. The mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is $84$, and the afternoon class's mean score is $70$. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is $\\frac{3}{4}$. What is the mean of the scores of all the students?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~74 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~75 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~76 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~77 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} Show that it is \\textbf{(C)} ~76.", "informal_proof": "Let there be $3x$ students in the morning class and $4x$ students in the afternoon class. The total number of students is $3x + 4x = 7x$. The average is $\\frac{3x\\cdot84 + 4x\\cdot70}{7x}=76$. Therefore, the answer is $\\textbf{(C)} ~76$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12b_2021_p4:\n  fixes m a :: nat\n  assumes h0: \"m / a = 3 / (4::real)\" \n  shows \"84 * m + 70 * a / (m + a) = (76::real)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12b_2021_p4\n  imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem amc12b_2021_p4:\n   fixes m a :: nat\n   assumes h0: \"of_nat m / of_nat a = 3 / (4::real)\" \n   shows \"(84 * m + 70 * a) / (m + a) = (76::real)\" \n   sorry\n\nend"}
