Give your answer as an ordered pair in the form $(s, t).$ Show that it is (1,4).", "informal_proof": "We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get  $$s=9-2(3s+1)=9-6s-2.$$Moving the variable terms to the left-hand side and the constants to the right-hand side, we find $$s+6s=7.$$This gives  $s=1$ which we may plug into either equation to get $t$. For example, $$t=3(1)+1=4.$$So the lines intersect at the point $(1,4)$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_44:\n  fixes s t :: real\n  assumes \"s = 9 - 2 * t\"\n    and \"t = 3 * s + 1\" \n  shows \"s = 1 \\<and> t = 4\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_44 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_44:\n  fixes s t :: real\n  assumes \"s = 9 - 2 * t\"\n    and \"t = 3 * s + 1\" \n  shows \"s = 1 \\<and> t = 4\"\n  using assms by auto\n\nend\n\n\n"}
