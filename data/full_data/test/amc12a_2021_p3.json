We add a $0$ whenever we multiply by $10$. So, removing the units digit is equal to dividing by $10$.\n\nLet the smaller number (the one we get after removing the units digit) be $a$. This means the bigger number would be $10a$.\n\nWe know the sum is $10a+a = 11a$ so $11a=17402$. So $a=1582$. The difference is $10a-a = 9a$. So, the answer is $9(1582) = \\textbf{(D)} ~14{,}238$.", "formal_statement": "theorem amc12a_2021_p3:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n assumes h0: \"x + y = 17402\"\n   and h1: \"10 dvd x\"\n   and h2: \"x div 10 = y\" \n shows \"x - y = 14238\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory amc12a_2021_p3\n  imports Complex_Main \nbegin\n\n\ntheorem amc12a_2021_p3:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n assumes h0: \"x + y = 17402\"\n   and h1: \"10 dvd x\"\n   and h2: \"x div 10 = y\" \n shows \"x - y = 14238\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
