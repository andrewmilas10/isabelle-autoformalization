What is the sum of the coordinates of point $A$? Show that it is 4.", "informal_proof": "If the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x,y)$ then $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the equations of both lines (as $A$ is on both lines). Substituting the first equation into the second gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x+5y &=11\\\\\n6y+5y&= 11\\\\\n11y&= 11\\\\\ny &= 1.\n\\end{align*}So now $x = 3y = 3$, and so the coordinates of point $A$ are $(3,1)$. The sum of these is $3+1 = 4$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_329:\n  fixes x y :: real\n  assumes \"3 * y = x\"\n    and \"2 * x + 5 * y = 11\" \n  shows \"x + y = 4\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_329 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_329:\n  fixes x y :: real\n  assumes \"3 * y = x\"\n    and \"2 * x + 5 * y = 11\" \n  shows \"x + y = 4\"\n  using assms by auto\n\nend"}
