So $4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \\iff 4x^3-1=7(y^3+286)$.\nWe also observe that for every integer $x$, the rest of the division of $x^3$ by $7$ is $0$, $1$, or $6$. So the rest of the division of $4x^3-1$ by $7$ is $6$, $3$, or $2$.\nAs a result, $7$ does not divide $4x^3-1$, but since $7(y^3+286)$ is divisible by $7$, the equation cannot have integers solutions.", "formal_statement": "theorem numbertheory_4x3m7y3neq2003:\n  fixes x y :: int\n  shows \"4 * x^3 - 7 * y^3 \\<noteq> 2003\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory numbertheory_4x3m7y3neq2003 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem numbertheory_4x3m7y3neq2003:\n  fixes x y :: int\n  shows \"4 * x^3 - 7 * y^3 \\<noteq> 2003\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
