Show that it is 4.", "informal_proof": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=4$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_1124:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n \\<le> 9\"\n    and \"18 dvd 374 * 10 + n\"\n  shows \"n = 4\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_1124 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_1124:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n \\<le> 9\"\n    and \"18 dvd 374 * 10 + n\"\n  shows \"n = 4\"\n  sorry\n\nend"}
