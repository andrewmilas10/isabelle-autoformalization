The next number in this sequence is $15$, but $15$ reduces to $2$ modulo $13$. That is: $$5\\cdot 1342 \\equiv 5\\cdot 3 \\equiv 2\\pmod{13}.$$Therefore, the number we are looking for is $5\\cdot 1342 = 6710$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_314:\n  fixes r n :: nat\n  assumes \"r = 1342 mod 13\"\n    and \"0 < n\"\n    and \"1342 dvd n\"\n    and \"n mod 13 < r\"\n  shows \"6710 \\<le> n\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_314 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_314:\n  fixes r n :: nat\n  assumes \"r = 1342 mod 13\"\n    and \"0 < n\"\n    and \"1342 dvd n\"\n    and \"n mod 13 < r\"\n  shows \"6710 \\<le> n\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n    "}
