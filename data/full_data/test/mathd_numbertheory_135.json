{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_135", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "Let $n = 3^{17} + 3^{10}$. It is known that $11$ divides into $n+1$. If $n$ can be written in base $10$ as $ABCACCBAB$, where $A,B,C$ are distinct digits such that $A$ and $C$ are odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$, find $100A + 10B + C$. Show that it is 129.", "informal_proof": "Notice that $3^{17} + 3^{10} = 3^{10} \\cdot (3^7 + 1)$; thus $9$ divides into $3^{17} + 3^{10}$. Furthermore, using the sum of seventh powers factorization, it follows that $3+1 = 4$ divides into $3^7 + 1$.\n\nUsing the divisibility criterion for $4$, we know that $\\overline{AB}$ must be divisible by $4$. Thus $B$ is even and not divisible by $3$. Also, $A$ is odd, so $\\overline{AB} = 10A + B$, where $4$ does not divide into $10A$. Thus, $4$ cannot divide into $B$ either, otherwise $10A + B$ would not be divisible by $4$. Then, $B$ must be equal to $2$.\n\nUsing the divisibility criterion for $9$, it follows that $3(A+B+C)$ is divisible by $9$, that is $3$ divides into $A+C+2$. Thus, $A+C = 4,7,10,13,16 \\quad (*)$. Using the divisibility criterion for $11$, since \\begin{align*}10^{8} \\cdot A + 10^7 \\cdot B + \\cdots + B &\\equiv (-1)^8 \\cdot A + (-1)^7 \\cdot B + \\cdots + B \\\\ &\\equiv A - B + \\cdots + B \\\\ &\\equiv -1 \\pmod{11},\\end{align*}then the alternating sum of digits, which works out to be $B+C-A \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $2+C-A$ is either equal to $10$ or $-1$, so $A-C = 3,-8$.\n\nIn the former case when $A-C = 3$, summing with $(*)$ yields that $2A \\in \\{7,10,13,16,19\\}$, of which only $A = 5$ fit the problem conditions. This yields that $C = 2$. However, we know that $B$ and $C$ are distinct, so we can eliminate this possibility. Thus, $A-C = -8$, of which only $C = 9, A = 1$ works. The answer is $129$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_135:\n  fixes n a b c::nat\n  assumes \"n = 3^17 + 3^10\"\n    and \"11 dvd (n + 1)\"\n    and \"odd a \\<and> odd c\"\n    and \"\\<not> 3 dvd b\"\n    and \"n = 10*(10*(10*(10*(10*(10*(10*(10*a +b) +c) +a) +c) +c) +b) +a) +b\" \n  shows \"10*(10 * a + b) + c = 129\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_135 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\nbegin\n\nfunction digits :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat list\" where \n   \"digits n = (if n div 10 = 0 then [n] else (n mod 10) # (digits (n div 10)))\"\n   by auto\n termination by (relation \"measure id\") auto\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_135:\n   fixes n a b c::nat\n   assumes \"n = 3^17 + 3^10\"\n     and \"11 dvd (n + 1)\"\n     and \"a\\<noteq>b\" \"b\\<noteq>c\" \"a\\<noteq>c\"\n     and \"a\\<in>{0..9}\" \"b\\<in>{0..9}\" \"c\\<in>{0..9}\" \n     and \"odd a \\<and> odd c\"\n     and \"\\<not> 3 dvd b\"\n     and \"digits n = [b,a,b,c,d,a,c,b,a]\" \n   shows \"10*(10 * a + b) + c = 129\"\n   sorry\n\nend\n    "}
