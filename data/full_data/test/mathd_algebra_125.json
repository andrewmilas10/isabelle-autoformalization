Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today? Show that it is 6.", "informal_proof": "Let $x$ be the son's age today and his father's age $y$.  We know: $5x = y$, and that $(x -3) + (y -3) = 30$.  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: $6x = 36$, and thus, $x=6$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_algebra_125:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n  assumes \"5 * x = y\"\n    and  \"(x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30\" \n  shows \"x = 6\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_algebra_125 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_algebra_125:\n  fixes x y :: nat\n  assumes \"5 * x = y\"\n    and  \"(x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30\" \n  shows \"x = 6\"\n  using assms by auto\nend   "}
