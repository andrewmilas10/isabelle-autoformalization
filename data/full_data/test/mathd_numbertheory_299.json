The commutative and associative properties of multiplication allow us to write the product as \\[\n1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = (\\text{some big odd number})\\cdot 5. \\\\\n\\]Since $a\\cdot 5$ has a ones digit of $5$ for any odd integer value of $a$, it doesn't matter what the big number is. The ones digit of the product is $5$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_299 :\n  \"(1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13) mod 10 = (5::nat)\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_299 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_299 :\n  \"(1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13) mod 10 = (5::nat)\" by eval\n\nend"}
