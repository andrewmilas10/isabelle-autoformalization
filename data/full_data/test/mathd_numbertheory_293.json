Show that it is 5.", "informal_proof": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = 5$ is the only digit that will work.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_293:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n \\<le> 9\"\n    and \"11 dvd 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7\" \n  shows \"n = 5\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_293 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_293:\n  fixes n :: nat\n  assumes \"n \\<le> 9\"\n    and \"11 dvd 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7\" \n  shows \"n = 5\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n\n\n    "}
