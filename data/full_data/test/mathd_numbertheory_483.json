{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_483", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 4? Show that it is 3.", "informal_proof": "If we look at the terms of the sequence mod 4, we see that they follow a pattern of period 6: \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4},~\\ldots\n\\end{align*} Then we see that the terms repeat.  Therefore, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term is the same as the $4^{\\text{th}}$ term, and thus has a remainder of $3$ when divided by 4.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_483:\n  fixes a :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\n  assumes \"a 1 = 1\"\n    and \"a 2 = 1\"\n    and \"\\<forall> n. a (n + 2) = a (n + 1) + a n\" \n    and \"\\<forall> n. a n>0\"\n  shows \"(a 100) mod 4 = 3\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_483 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_483:\n  fixes a :: \"nat \\<Rightarrow> nat\"\n  assumes \"a 1 = 1\"\n    and \"a 2 = 1\"\n    and \"\\<forall> n. a (n + 2) = a (n + 1) + a n\" \n    and \"\\<forall> n. a n>0\"\n  shows \"(a 100) mod 4 = 3\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n    "}
