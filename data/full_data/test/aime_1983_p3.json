Show that it is 020.", "informal_proof": "If we were to expand by squaring, we would get a [[quartic Equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]], which isn't always the easiest thing to deal with.\n\nInstead, we substitute $y$ for $x^2+18x+30$, so that the equation becomes $y=2\\sqrt{y+15}$.\n\nNow we can square; solving for $y$, we get $y=10$ or $y=-6$. The second root is extraneous since $2\\sqrt{y+15}$ is always non-negative (and moreover, plugging in $y=-6$, we get $-6=6$, which is obviously false). Hence we have $y=10$ as the only solution for $y$. Substituting $x^2+18x+30$ back in for $y$,\n\n<center>$x^2+18x+30=10 \\Longrightarrow x^2+18x+20=0.$</center> Both of the roots of this equation are real, since its discriminant is $18^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 20 = 244$, which is positive. Thus by [[Vieta's formulas]], the product of the real roots is simply $020$.", "formal_statement": "theorem aime_1983_p3:\n  fixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. f x = (x^2 + (18 * x +  30) - 2 \n                    * sqrt (x^2 + (18 * x + 45)))\"\n  shows \"(\\<Prod> (f -` {0})) = 20\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory aime_1983_p3 imports Complex_Main\nbegin\n\ntheorem aime_1983_p3:\n  fixes f :: \"real \\<Rightarrow> real\"\n  assumes h0 : \"\\<forall> x. f x = (x^2 + (18 * x +  30) - 2 \n                    * sqrt (x^2 + (18 * x + 45)))\"\n  shows \"(\\<Prod> (f -` {0})) = 20\"\n  sorry\n\nend\n"}
