{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_521", "category": "unknown", "metadata": {}, "informal_statement": "The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers? Show that it is 18.", "informal_proof": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $18$.", "formal_statement": "theorem mathd_numbertheory_521:\n  fixes m n :: nat\n  assumes \"even m\"\n    and \"even n\"\n    and \"m - n = 2\"\n    and \"m * n = 288\"\n  shows \"m = 18\"", "formal_code": "(*\n  Authors: Wenda Li\n*)\n\ntheory mathd_numbertheory_521 \n  imports Complex_Main \"HOL-Computational_Algebra.Computational_Algebra\"\n  \"HOL-Number_Theory.Number_Theory\"\nbegin\n\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_521:\n  fixes m n :: nat\n  assumes \"even m\"\n    and \"even n\"\n    and \"m - n = 2\"\n    and \"m * n = 288\"\n  shows \"m = 18\"\n  sorry\n\nend   "}
